<p>The subject of this memoir was born on the 25th
of October, 1735, at Laurencekirk, in the county
of Kincardine, Scotland. His father, James
Beattie, who kept a small shop in the village at
the same time that he rented a little farm in the
neighbourhood, was a man of considerable talents
and acquirements:<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> his mother, too, was distinguished
for her abilities. Our author, James,
was the youngest of the six children of this respectable
pair.</p>

<p>After his father's decease, which happened
when he was only seven years old, his mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
by means of the emoluments derived from the
shop and the farm, was enabled to bring up her
family in comfort. In the management of her
affairs she was assisted by her eldest son, David,
a youth of eighteen, who generously and affectionately
relinquished all other pursuits for that
of promoting her welfare and happiness, and who
appears to have fostered his brothers and sisters
with an almost parental care. James was placed
at the parish school of Laurencekirk, which was
then in some repute, and of which, about forty
years before, Ruddiman, the famous grammarian,
had been the master. At this time he had access
to few books, except those which the minister of
the village (the Rev. Mr. Thomson) kindly lent
him, and which he read with avidity. It was
then that he first became acquainted with English
versification in Ogilby's Virgil. Even then
he was known among his schoolfellows by the
name of <i>the poet</i>; and sometimes he would rise
from bed, during the night, that he might commit
to writing any poetical idea that his fancy
had happened to suggest.</p>

<p>In 1749 he began his academical career, at the
Marischal College, Aberdeen:<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and as his cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>cumstances
were straitened, he became a competitor&mdash;and
with success&mdash;for one of those bursaries
or exhibitions, which are annually bestowed
on students who are unable to support the entire
expenses of a university education. He attended
the Greek class taught by Dr. Blackwell.
This scholar, whose writings on classical subjects,<a name="FNanchor_B_3" id="FNanchor_B_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
though now fallen into disrepute, once
enjoyed considerable popularity, soon discovered
that his pupil was no ordinary young man, and
distinguished him by several encouraging marks
of approbation. The kindness of the Professor
made a deep impression on the mind of Beattie,
and he used to declare, in after life, that Blackwell
was the first person who gave him reason to
believe that he was possessed of any genius.
During the four years of his attendance at the
Marischal College he also studied philosophy and
divinity. The last mentioned branch of knowledge
he pursued doubtless with a view to the ministry,
the church being then the chief resource of the
well educated sons of the poorer classes in Scotland:
he, however, soon abandoned all thoughts
of the clerical profession.</p>

<p>Having taken the degree of M. A., he was
elected, on the 1st of August, 1753, schoolmaster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
of Fordoun, a small hamlet at the foot of the
Grampian hills, about six miles distant from his
birthplace: here also he officiated as pr&aelig;centor,
or parish-clerk.</p>

<p>Many an hour was now spent by Beattie in
perfect solitude; the family of Mr. Forbes, the
minister, being almost the only society, save the
surrounding peasantry, which his situation allowed
him to enjoy. But his days went happily by.
When not occupied by his public duties, he appears
to have devoted a portion of his time to
the study of the classics;<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and occasionally he
amused himself by composing little poems, a few
of which were printed in the Scots Magazine.
His fondness for music had ever been decided;
and in his present retirement he cultivated it
with uncommon success.<a name="FNanchor_B_5" id="FNanchor_B_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> In the grand and
beautiful scenery of the neighbourhood he found
a never-failing source of pleasure. Not far from
the place where he dwelt, a large and well wooded
glen communicates with the mountains. In it
he loved to wander; in it some of his earliest
verses were written; and his recollections of its
wild and romantic charms may be traced in several
vivid descriptions of nature in his poetical
works. Sometimes he would pass the whole
night among the fields, gazing on the sky, and
observing the various aspects it assumed till the
return of day; and the exhilarating song of "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
lyric lark" in the mornings of summer used to
fill him with delight. In 1755, his loneliness
was cheered by the arrival of his brother David,
who came to settle himself at the village of Fordoun.</p>

<p>The celebrated and eccentric Francis Garden,
Esq., (afterwards one of the judges of the supreme
courts of civil and criminal law in Scotland, by
the title of Lord Gardenstone,) who was then
sheriff of the county of Kincardine, and occasionally
resided in the neighbourhood of Fordoun,
was the earliest patron of our author.
They accidentally became acquainted with each
Other. Mr. Garden having one day discovered
Beattie busily writing with a pencil in his favourite
glen, and learning that he was engaged
in the composition of a poem,<a name="FNanchor_A_6" id="FNanchor_A_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> from that period
took him under his protection.</p>

<p>At this time too he became known to another
more celebrated and more eccentric character,
Lord Monboddo, whose family estate is in the
parish of Fordoun; and though their opinions on
some important points by no means coincided,
they ever after lived on friendly terms.</p>

<p>In 1757, the place of usher in the grammar-school
of Aberdeen being vacant, Beattie, by the
advice of Mr. Forbes, the minister of Fordoun,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>became a candidate for it, but without success.
So conspicuously, however, had his abilities manifested
themselves during his examination on
that occasion, that the same place becoming
again vacant about a year after, and two candidates
having appeared, both of whom were declared
unqualified for it, he was requested by the
magistrates to fill it without further trial. He
was accordingly elected to the office on the 20th
June, 1758.</p>

<p>This was an important event in Beattie's life.
From a secluded hamlet, where there was the
greatest difficulty in obtaining either society or
books, he was transplanted to a populous and
flourishing town, where he might associate with
those whose tastes were congenial with his own,
and carry on his literary pursuits by means of
public libraries. The friend of his earlier years,
Professor Blackwell, had sunk into the grave;
but he had soon the good fortune to become
intimately acquainted with several persons of acknowledged
talents and learning, connected with
the Marischal and King's Colleges, as also with
various well educated gentlemen, inhabitants of
the town.</p>

<p>In 1760, a chair in the Marischal College becoming
vacant, it was suggested to Beattie by
his friend, Mr. Arbuthnot,<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> that he should en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>deavour
to procure the appointment for himself.
Our author, who had never dreamed of aspiring
to so dignified a situation, heard the proposal
with astonishment. Mr. Arbuthnot, however,
"willing to try what could be done," induced
the Earl of Erroll, with whom he was on intimate
terms, to solicit, by means of Lord Milton, the
powerful interest of the Duke of Argyll in behalf
of the humble usher. The application proved
successful; and on the 8th October, 1760, Beattie
was installed Professor of Moral Philosophy and
Logic in the Marischal College.</p>

<p>His first lectures were delivered during the
winter session of 1760, and 1761; and for the
long space of more than thirty years he continued
to discharge most conscientiously the duties of
the important station to which he had been so
unexpectedly raised.</p>

<p>A literary and convivial club (to which the
vulgar gave the nickname of the <i>Wise Club</i>) had
been established for some years at Aberdeen, the
members consisting of the Professors of the Marischal
and King's Colleges, and of gentlemen of
the town, who had a taste for literature and conversation.
Into this society Beattie was now
enrolled. They used to meet at a tavern, once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>a fortnight, at five o'clock in the afternoon, (for
in those days the common dinner-hour was early)
when, the president taking the chair, an essay
was read, composed by one of the members in
his turn, and a literary or philosophical subject
discussed; at half past eight a slight meal was
served up, and at ten they retired to their homes.
To this club Dr. Reid, Dr. Campbell, Dr. Gerrard,
and Dr. Gregory, belonged; and from it
several admired works of philosophy and criticism
may be said to have originated.</p>

<p>In 1761 Beattie made his first appearance in
print, in his own character, by publishing a small
volume, dedicated to the Earl of Erroll, entitled
<i>Original Poems and Translations</i>. It consisted
partly of some of the verses which he had formerly
sent to the Scots Magazine, and partly of pieces
which he had recently composed. "This collection,"
says his good-natured and not very tasteful
biographer, Sir William Forbes, "was very
favourably received, and stamped Dr. Beattie
with the character of a poet of great and original
genius." It was certainly "favourably received,"
the chief critical journals of the day being unanimous
in its praise; but that it "stamped the
author with the character of a poet of great and
original genius," I cannot allow. The truth is,
it does not contain a single poem which rises
much above mediocrity; and if Beattie had never
touched the lyre with a more powerful hand, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
memoir of his life would not have been required for
the Aldine Poets. So lightly, indeed, did he himself
afterwards think of the collection in question,
that he used to destroy all the copies of it which
he could procure, and would only suffer four
pieces from it (and these much altered and improved)
to stand in the same volume with <i>The
Minstrel</i>.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1763, Beattie for the
first time visited London, among the inhabitants
of which, Millar, his publisher, was almost his
only acquaintance. While residing there, he
made a pilgrimage to Pope's villa at Twickenham.</p>

<p><i>The Judgment of Paris</i>, printed in 4to, in
1765, was the least successful of our author's
poetical works. Several passages of considerable
beauty could not prevent this elaborate, cold,
and metaphysical production from being utterly
neglected by the public.</p>

<p>That his <i>Verses on the death of Churchill</i>
(which appeared anonymously very soon after
<i>The Judgment of Paris</i>) were read with more

of the piece than to its intrinsic merit.<a name="FNanchor_A_8" id="FNanchor_A_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
can peruse it without regretting that the amiable
Beattie should have been betrayed by political
feelings into such virulent abuse of a man of
genius, who had just been gathered to the poets
of other days. He is said to have written it at
the solicitation of certain friends in Scotland,
where the name of Churchill was held in detestation;
and on these injudicious instigators let a
portion of the odium rest.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1765, Gray, who was then
regarded as the first of living bards, paid a visit
to the Earl of Strathmore, at Glammis castle.
No sooner did Beattie hear of his arrival than he
addressed to him the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>Marischal College of Aberdeen, 30th August, 1765.</small></p>

<p>"If I thought it necessary to offer an apology
for venturing to address you in this abrupt manner,
I should be very much at a loss how to begin.
I might plead my admiration of your genius, and
my attachment to your character; but who is he
that could not, with truth, urge the same excuse
for intruding upon your retirement? I might
plead my earnest desire to be personally acquainted
with a man whom I have so long and so passionately
admired in his writings; but thousands of
greater consequence than I, are ambitious of the
same honour. I, indeed, must either flatter myself
that no apology is necessary, or otherwise I
must despair of obtaining what has long been
the object of my most ardent wishes; I must for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>ever
forfeit all hopes of seeing you, and conversing
with you.</p>

<p>"It was yesterday I received the agreeable
news of your being in Scotland, and of your intending
to visit some parts of it. Will you permit
us to hope, that we shall have an opportunity,
at Aberdeen, of thanking you in person, for the
honour you have done to Britain, and to the poetic
art, by your inestimable compositions, and of
offering you all that we have that deserves your
acceptance, namely, hearts full of esteem, respect,
and affection? If you cannot come so far northward,
let me at least be acquainted with the place
of your residence, and permitted to wait on you.
Forgive, sir, this request; forgive me if I urge it
with earnestness, for indeed it concerns me nearly;
and do me the justice to believe, that I am, with
the most sincere attachment, and most respectful
esteem, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P. S. Dr. Carlysle of Musselburgh, and Dr.
Wight of Glasgow, acquainted me of your being
in Scotland. It was from them I learned that my
name was not wholly unknown to you."</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of this letter, Beattie received
an invitation to Glammis castle; and a friendship
and correspondence commenced between the
two poets, which terminated only with the death
of Gray. The impression which their first meeting
made on our author he thus describes in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
letter to Sir William Forbes:&mdash;"I am sorry you
did not see Mr. Gray on his return; you would
have been much pleased with him. Setting aside
his merit as a poet, which, however, in my opinion,
is greater than any of his contemporaries can
boast, in this or in any other nation, I found him
possessed of the most exact taste, the soundest
judgment, and the most extensive learning. He
is happy in a singular facility of expression. His
conversation abounds in original observations, delivered
with no appearance of sententious formality,
and seeming to arise spontaneously without
study or premeditation. I passed two very agreeable
days with him in Glammis, and found him
as easy in his manners, and as communicative and
frank, as I could have wished."</p>

<p>A new edition of our author's Poems came forth
in 1766. From it a large portion of the pieces
published in the former collection was rejected;
while <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>, the <i>Lines on the
Death of Churchill</i>, and one or two copies of
verses never before printed, supplied the deficiency.
The translation of Addison's <i>Pygm&aelig;ogeranomachia</i>,
which concludes the volume, is remarkable
for its spirited and graceful versification.</p>

<p>In a letter to Dr. Blacklock, dated 22d September
in the same year, Beattie thus alludes to
his great work, <i>The Minstrel</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not long ago I began a poem in the style
and stanza of Spenser, in which I propose to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
full scope to my inclination, and be either droll
or pathetic, descriptive or sentimental, tender or
satirical, as the humour strikes me; for, if I mistake
not, the manner which I have adopted admits
equally of all these kinds of composition. I
have written one hundred and fifty lines, and am
surprised to find the structure of that complicated
stanza so little troublesome. I was always fond
of it, for I think it the most harmonious that ever
was contrived. It admits of more variety of
pauses than either the couplet or the alternate
rhyme; and it concludes with a pomp and majesty
of sound, which, to my ear, is wonderfully
delightful. It seems also very well adapted to
the genius of our language, which, from its irregularity
of inflexion and number of monosyllables,
abounds in diversified terminations, and consequently
renders our poetry susceptible of an endless
variety of legitimate rhymes. But I am so
far from intending this performance for the press,
that I am morally certain it never will be finished.
I shall add a stanza now and then, when I am at
leisure, and when I have no humour for any other
amusement; but I am resolved to write no more
poetry with a view to publication, till I see some
dawnings of a poetical taste among the generality
of readers, of which, however, there is not at present
any thing like an appearance."</p>

<p>Writing to Sir William Forbes, 8th January,
1767, our author gives an account of the cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
of his composing <i>The Hermit</i>, the most perfect of
his minor poems:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The favourable reception you gave to my
little poem, demands my acknowledgments. I
aimed at simplicity in the expression, and something
like uncommonness in the thought; and I
own I am not ill pleased with it upon the whole;
though I am sensible it does not answer the purpose
for which I made it. I wrote it at the desire
of a young lady of this country, who has a
taste both for poetry and music, and wanted me
to make words for a Scots tune called 'Pentland
Hills,' of which she is very fond. The verses correspond
well enough with the measure and subject
of the tune, but are extremely unsuitable for
the purpose of a song."<a name="FNanchor_A_9" id="FNanchor_A_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>To Dr. Blacklock he again writes concerning
<i>The Minstrel</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Aberdeen, 20th May, 1767.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My</span> performance in Spenser's stanza has not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
advanced a single line these many months. It is
called 'The Minstrel.' The subject was suggested
by a dissertation on the old minstrels,
which is prefixed to a collection of Ballads lately
published by Dodsley, in three volumes. I propose
to give an account of the birth, education,
and adventures of one of those bards; in which
I shall have full scope for description, sentiment,
satire, and even a certain species of humour and
of pathos, which, in the opinion of my great master
are by no means inconsistent, as is evident
from his works. My hero is to be born in the
south of Scotland; which you know was the native
land of the English minstrels; I mean of
those minstrels who travelled into England, and
supported themselves there by singing their ballads
to the harp. His father is a shepherd. The
son will have a natural taste for music and the
beauties of nature; which, however, languishes
for want of culture, till in due time he meets with
a hermit, who gives him some instruction; but
endeavours to check his genius for poetry and adventures,
by representing the happiness of obscurity
and solitude, and the bad reception which
poetry has met with in almost every age. The
poor swain acquiesces in this advice, and resolves
to follow his father's employment; when, on a
sudden, the country is invaded by the Danes, or
English borderers, (I know not which,) and he is
stript of all his little fortune, and obliged by ne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>cessity
to commence minstrel. This is all that I
have as yet concerted of the plan. I have written
one hundred and fifty lines, but my hero is not
yet born, though now in a fair way of being so,
for his parents are described and married. I know
not whether I shall ever proceed any farther:
however, I am not dissatisfied with what I have
written."</p>
</div>

<p>On the 28th June, 1767, Beattie was married
at Aberdeen to Miss Mary Dun, only daughter of
the rector of the Grammar-school in that city; a
mutual attachment having for some time existed
between them. She was a few years younger
than our author: her person was pleasing, her
manners were lively; and she possessed a moderate
share of accomplishments. This union,
which seemed to promise nothing but happiness
to Beattie, threw the blight of misery over
his later years, and undoubtedly contributed to
shorten his career. The woman whom he had
selected as a partner for life, inherited from her
mother the most dreadful of human maladies,&mdash;insanity;
which, a few years after marriage, displayed
itself in strange follies and caprices,<a name="FNanchor_A_10" id="FNanchor_A_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> and
at last broke forth with such violence, as to render
her separation from her family absolutely neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>sary.
By this lady he had two sons, of whom
particular mention will be made hereafter.</p>

<p>Beattie now employed himself on the composition
of his <i>Essay on Truth</i>, a work, which was
to be honoured with such marks of public approbation,
as the most sanguine author in his wildest
dreams of success could hardly have anticipated.
In a letter to Sir William Forbes, dated 17th
January, 1768, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have, for a time, laid aside my favourite
studies, that I might have leisure to prosecute a
philosophical inquiry, less amusing indeed than
poetry and criticism, but not less important. The
extraordinary success of the sceptical philosophy
has long filled me with regret. I wish I could
undeceive mankind in regard to this matter. Perhaps
this wish is vain: but it can do no harm to
make the trial. The point I am now labouring
to prove, is the universality and immutability of
moral sentiment,&mdash;a point which has been brought
into dispute, both by the friends and by the enemies
of virtue. In an age less licentious in its
principles, it would not, perhaps, be necessary to
insist much on this point. At present it is very
necessary. Philosophers have ascribed all religion
to human policy. Nobody knows how soon
they may ascribe all morality to the same origin;
and then the foundations of human society, as
well as of human happiness, will be effectually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
undermined. To accomplish this end, Hobbes,
Hume, Mandeville, and even Locke, have laboured;
and, I am sorry to say, from my knowledge
of mankind, that their labour has not been
altogether in vain. Not that the works of these
philosophers are generally read, or even understood
by the few who read them. It is not the mode,
now-a-days, for a man to think for himself; but
they greedily adopt the conclusions, without any
concern about the arguments or principles whence
they proceed; and they justify their own credulity
by general declamations upon the transcendent
merit of their favourite authors, and the universal
deference that is paid to their genius and
learning. If I can prove those authors guilty of
gross misrepresentations of matters of fact, unacquainted
with the human heart, ignorant even of
their own principles, the dupes of verbal ambiguities,
and the votaries of frivolous, though dangerous
philosophy, I shall do some little service
to the cause of truth; and all this I will undertake
to prove in many instances of high importance."</p>

<p>During this year, a poem in broad Scotch, entitled
<i>The Fortunate Shepherdess</i>, by Alexander
Ross, schoolmaster, of Lochlee, was printed by
subscription at Aberdeen; and in order to excite
some curiosity about the volume, Beattie good-naturedly
wrote a copy of verses in the same dia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>lect,
addressed to the author, which appeared in
the Aberdeen Journal.<a name="FNanchor_A_11" id="FNanchor_A_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>He thus communicates to Dr. Blacklock his
motives for attempting the laborious prose work,
with which he was still occupied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Aberdeen, 9th January, 1769.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">It</span> was very kind in you to read over my
'Essay on the Immutability of Moral Sentiment'
with so much attention. I wish it deserved any
part of the high encomium you bestowed on it.
I flatter myself it will receive considerable improvements
from a second transcribing, which I
intend to begin as soon as I can. Some parts of
it will be enlarged, and others (perhaps) shortened:
the examples from history, and authorities
from ancient authors, will be more numerous; it
will be regularly distributed into chapters and sections,
and the language will be corrected through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>out.
The first part, which treats of the permanency
of truth in general, is now in great forwardness;
ninety pages in quarto are finished,
and materials provided for as many more. The
design of the whole you will guess from the part
you have seen. It is to overthrow scepticism,
and establish conviction in its place; a conviction
not in the least favourable to bigotry or prejudice,
far less to a persecuting spirit; but such a conviction
as produces firmness of mind, and stability
of principle, in a consistence with moderation,
candour, and liberal inquiry. If I understand
my own design, it is certainly this; whether I
shall accomplish this design or not, the event only
will determine. Meantime I go on with cheerfulness
in this intricate and fatiguing study, because
I would fain hope that it may do some good;
harm I think it cannot possibly do any.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are anxious to know what first
induced me to write on the subject; I will tell
you as briefly as I can. In my younger days I
read chiefly for the sake of amusement, and I
found myself best amused with the classics, and
what we call the <i>belles lettres</i>. Metaphysics I
disliked; mathematics pleased me better; but I
found my mind neither improved nor gratified by
that study. When Providence allotted me my
present station, it became incumbent on me to
read what had been written on the subject of
morals and human nature; the works of Locke,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
Berkeley, and Hume, were celebrated as masterpieces
in this way; to them, therefore, I had recourse.
But, as I begin to study them with great
prejudices in their favour, you will readily conceive
how strangely I was surprised to find them,
as I thought, replete with absurdities. I pondered
these absurdities: I weighed the arguments, with
which I was sometimes not a little confounded;
and the result was, that I began at last to suspect
my own understanding, and to think that I had
not capacity for such a study. For I could not
conceive it possible, that the absurdities of these
authors were so great as they seemed to me to be;
otherwise, thought I, the world would never admire
them so much. About this time some excellent
antisceptical works made their appearance,
particularly Reid's 'Inquiry into the Human
Mind.' Then it was that I began to have
a little more confidence in my own judgment,
when I found it confirmed by those of whose abilities
I did not entertain the least distrust. I reviewed
my authors again, with a very different
temper of mind. A very little truth will sometimes
enlighten a vast extent of science. I found
that the sceptical philosophy was not what the
world imagined it to be, nor what I, following the
opinion of the world, had hitherto imagined it to
be, but a frivolous, though dangerous, system of
verbal subtilty, which it required neither genius,
nor learning, nor taste, nor knowledge of mankind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
to be able to put together; but only a captious
temper, an irreligious spirit, a moderate command
of words, and an extraordinary degree of vanity
and presumption. You will easily perceive that
I am speaking of this philosophy only in its most
extravagant state, that is, as it appears in the
works of Mr. Hume. The more I study it, the
more am I confirmed in this opinion. But while
I applauded and admired the sagacity of those
who led me into, or at least encouraged me to proceed
in, this train of thinking, I was not altogether
satisfied with them in another respect. I could not
approve that extraordinary adulation which some
of them paid to their arch-adversary. I could not
conceive the propriety of paying compliments to
a man's <i>heart</i>, at the very time one is proving
that his aim is to subvert the principles of truth,
virtue, and religion; nor to his <i>understanding</i>,
when we are charging him with publishing the
grossest and most contemptible nonsense. I
thought I then foresaw, what I have since found
to happen, that this controversy will be looked
upon rather as a trial of skill between two logicians,
than as a disquisition in which the best
interests of mankind were concerned; and that
the world, especially the fashionable part of it,
would still be disposed to pay the greatest deference
to the opinions of him who, even by the
acknowledgment of his antagonists, was confessed to
be the best philosopher and the soundest reasoner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>
All this has happened, and more. Some, to my certain
knowledge, have said, that Mr. Hume and
his adversaries did really act in concert, in order
mutually to promote the sale of one another's
works; as a proof of which, they mention, not
only the extravagant compliments that pass between
them, but also the circumstance of Dr. R.<a name="FNanchor_A_12" id="FNanchor_A_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
and Dr. C.<a name="FNanchor_B_13" id="FNanchor_B_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> sending their manuscripts to be perused
and corrected by Mr. Hume before they
gave them to the press. I, who know both the
men, am very sensible of the gross falsehood of
these reports. As to the affair of the manuscripts,
it was, I am convinced, candour and modesty that
induced them to it. But the world knows no such
thing; and, therefore, may be excused for mistaking
the meaning of actions that have really an
equivocal appearance. I know likewise that they
are sincere, not only in the detestation they express
for Mr. Hume's irreligious tenets, but also
in the compliments they have paid to his talents;
for they both look upon him as an extraordinary
genius; a point in which I cannot agree with
them. But while I thus vindicate them from imputations,
which the world, from its ignorance of
circumstances, has laid to their charge, I cannot
approve them in every thing; I wish they had
carried their researches a little farther, and expressed
themselves with a little more firmness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>
and spirit. For well I know, that their works, for
want of this, will never produce that effect which
(if all mankind were cool metaphysical reasoners)
might be expected from them. There is another
thing in which my judgment differs considerably
from that of the gentlemen just mentioned. They
have great metaphysical abilities, and they love
the metaphysical sciences. I do not. I am
convinced that this metaphysical spirit is the
bane of true learning, true taste, and true science;
that to it we owe all this modern scepticism and
atheism; that it has a bad effect upon the human
faculties, and tends not a little to sour the temper,
to subvert good principles, and to disqualify men
for the business of life. You will now see wherein
my views differ from those of the other answerers
of Mr. Hume. I want to show the world, that
the sceptical philosophy is contradictory to itself,
and destructive of genuine philosophy, as well as
of religion and virtue; that it is in its own nature
so paltry a thing (however it may have been
celebrated by some,) that to be despised it needs
only to be known; that no degree of genius is
necessary to qualify a man for making a figure in
this pretended science; but rather a certain minuteness
and suspiciousness of mind, and want
of sensibility, the very reverse of true intellectual
excellence; that metaphysics cannot possibly do
any good, but may do, and actually have done,
much harm; that sceptical philosophers, whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>
they may pretend, are the corrupters of science,
the pests of society, and the enemies of mankind.
I want to show, that the same method of reasoning,
which these people have adopted in their
books, if transferred into common life, would show
them to be destitute of common sense; that true
philosophers follow a different method of reasoning:
and that, without following a different method,
no truth can be discovered. I want to lay before
the public, in as strong a light as possible, the
following dilemma: our sceptics either believe
the doctrines they publish, or they do not believe
them: if they believe them, they are fools&mdash;if
not, they are a thousand times worse. I want
also to fortify the mind against the sceptical
poison, and to propose certain criteria of moral
truth, by which some of the most dangerous
sceptical errors may be detected and guarded
against.</p>

<p>"You are sensible, that, in order to attain
these ends, it is absolutely necessary for me to
use great plainness of speech. My expressions
must not be so tame as to seem to imply either a
diffidence in my principles, or a coldness towards
the cause I have undertaken to defend. And
where is the man who can blame me for speaking
from the heart, and therefore speaking with
warmth, when I appear in the cause of truth, religion,
virtue, and mankind? I am sure my dear
friend Dr. Blacklock will not; he, who has set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
before me so many examples of this laudable ardour;
he, whose style I should be proud to take
for my model, if I were not aware of the difficulty,
I may say, the insuperable difficulty, of
imitating it with success. You need not fear,
however, that I expose myself by an excess of
passion or petulance. I hope I shall be animated,
without losing my temper, and keen, without
injury to good manners. In a word, I will be
as soft and delicate as the subject and my conscience
will allow. One gentleman, a friend of
yours,<a name="FNanchor_A_14" id="FNanchor_A_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> I shall have occasion to treat with much
freedom. I have heard of his virtues. I know
he has many virtues; God forbid I should ever
seek to lessen them, or wish them to be found
insincere. I hope they are sincere, and that they
will increase in number and merit every day. To
his virtues I shall do justice; but I must also do
justice to his faults, at least to those faults which
are public, and which, for the sake of truth and
of mankind, ought not to be concealed or disguised.
Personal reflections will be carefully
avoided; I hope I am in no danger of falling into
them, for I bear no personal animosity against
any man whatsoever: sometimes I may perhaps
be keen; but I trust I shall never depart from
the Christian and philosophic character.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>"A scheme like this of mine cannot be popular,
far less can it be lucrative. It will raise me
enemies; it will expose me to the scrutiny of the
most rigid criticism; it will make me be considered
by many as a sullen and illiberal bigot. I
trust, however, in Providence, and in the goodness
of my cause, that my attempts in behalf of truth
shall not be altogether ineffectual, and that my
labours shall be attended with some utility to my
fellow-creatures. This, in my estimation, will do
much more than counterbalance all the inconveniences
I have any reason to apprehend. I have
already fallen on evil tongues (as Milton says) on
account of this intended publication. It has
been reported, that I had written a most scurrilous
paper against Mr. Hume, and was preparing
to publish it when a friend of mine interposed,
and, with very great difficulty, prevailed
on me to suppress it, because he knew it would
hurt or ruin my character. Such is the treatment
I have to expect from one set of people. I was
so provoked when I first heard this calumny that
I deliberated whether I should not throw my papers
into the fire, with a <i>Si populus vult decipi,
decipiatur</i>: but I rejected that thought; for so
many persons have told me, that it was my <i>duty</i>
to publish these papers, that I almost began to
think so myself. Many have urged me to publish
them; none ever dissuaded me. The gentleman,
named in the report, read the essay, and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>turned
it with the highest commendations; but
I do not recollect that he ever spoke a syllable
about publishing or suppressing it. But I have
certainly tired you with so long a detail, about
so trifling a matter as my works. However, I
thought it necessary to say something by way of
apology for them, for I find that your good opinion
is of too much consequence to my peace,
to suffer me to neglect any opportunity of cultivating
it."</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Essay on Truth</i> being now finished, our
author was desirous of selling the MS. to some
bookseller, in order that he might avoid all risk
to himself in the publication, and intrusted the
care of this matter to Sir William Forbes and
Mr. Arbuthnot. His two friends, however, having
applied to the bookseller, whom they imagined
the most proper person to publish the work, were
vexed by his positive refusal to purchase it, although
he had no objection to print it on Beattie's
account. In this difficulty they generously resolved
to become themselves the purchasers of
the first edition. "I therefore," says Sir William
Forbes, "wrote to him [Beattie] (nothing surely
but the truth, although, I confess, not the whole
truth,) that the manuscript was sold for fifty guineas,
which I remitted to him by a bank bill; and
I added, that we had stipulated with the bookseller
who was to print the book, that we should
be partners in the publication."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>At length in May, 1770, the <i>Essay on Truth</i>
was given to the world. As it had been seen in
manuscript by several eminent literary characters,
and as it was understood to be a direct attack
on the philosophy of Hume (who was then
in the height of his popularity,) its appearance
excited immediate notice. It has been said,
that on its publication, Hume spoke of Beattie
with great bitterness, complaining (and I am
forced to allow that there was some cause for the
complaint) that he had not used him like a gentleman:
it has even been asserted that he could
not endure the name of our author to be mentioned
in his presence. I suspect that in all this
there is great exaggeration. The placid temper
of Hume was not likely to be much ruffled by
any thing that might be written against his system;
his friends and admirers were probably
more disturbed by the attack than the philosopher
himself. In less than four years five large
editions of the <i>Essay</i> were circulated, and translations
of it were made into French and other
foreign languages.</p>

<p>From the rugged paths of philosophy Beattie
turned once more into the flowery walks of poesy.
In 1771, the First Book of <i>The Minstrel</i> was published
without the author's name. Its success was
complete. The voice of every critic was loud in
its praise; and before the Second Book appeared
(in 1774), four editions of the First had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
dispersed throughout the kingdom. The following
elegant and touching encomium was passed
upon the poem by Lord Lyttelton, in a letter to
Mrs. Montagu, who had put the First Book into
the hands of that virtuous nobleman:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Hill Street, 8th March, 1771.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I read</span> your 'Minstrel' last night, with as
much rapture as poetry, in her noblest, sweetest
charms, ever raised in my soul. It seemed to me
that my once most beloved minstrel, Thomson,
was come down from heaven, refined by the converse
of purer spirits than those he lived with
here, to let me hear him sing again the beauties
of nature, and the finest feelings of virtue, not
with human, but with angelic strains! I beg
you to express my gratitude to the poet for the
pleasure he has given me."</p>
</div>

<p>Of the same date with the preceding letter,
Beattie received one from Gray, containing many
minute remarks on his poem. As it consists almost
entirely of verbal criticism, it scarcely admits
of quotation: a single short extract may however
be given from it:</p>

<p>"St. 11. <i>O, how canst thou renounce</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_15" id="FNanchor_A_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> &amp;c.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>But this, of all others, is my favourite stanza.
It is true poetry; it is inspiration; only (to show
it is mortal) there is one blemish; the word
<i>garniture</i> suggesting an idea of dress, and, what
is worse, of French dress."</p>

<p>When the poem was reprinted, one or two
slight alterations were made in deference to the
opinion of Gray.</p>

<p>In a letter to the Dowager Lady Forbes, 12th
October, 1772, our author confesses that in the
character of Edwin he meant to paint himself:</p>

<p>"From the questions your Ladyship is pleased
to propose in the conclusion of your letter, as
well as from some things I have had the honour
to hear you advance in conversation, I find you
are willing to suppose that, in Edwin, I have
given only a picture of myself, as I was in my
younger days. I confess the supposition is not
groundless. I have made him take pleasure in
the scenes in which I took pleasure, and entertain
sentiments similar to those of which, even in
my early youth, I had repeated experience. The
scenery of a mountainous country, the ocean, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>sky, thoughtfulness and retirement, and sometimes
melancholy objects and ideas, had charms
in my eyes, even when I was a schoolboy: and
at a time when I was so far from being able to
express, that I did not understand my own feelings,
or perceive the tendency of such pursuits
and amusements; and as to poetry and music,
before I was ten years old I could play a little
on the violin, and was as much master of Homer
and Virgil as Pope's and Dryden's translations
could make me."</p>

<p>The intense thought which Beattie had devoted
to the composition of the <i>Essay on Truth</i> having
materially injured his health, he was advised by his
physicians to try the remedy of change of scene.
He accordingly set out on a journey to London,
and arrived there in the beginning of autumn,
1771. He was no longer the obscure individual
who had visited it in 1763;<a name="FNanchor_A_16" id="FNanchor_A_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> he was now the triumphant
adversary of scepticism, and the author
of the admired <i>Minstrel</i>; a man whom the most
distinguished characters in the literary and fashionable
world were prepared to treat with attention
and respect. Among several letters of introduction,
which he carried with him, was one from
Dr. Gregory, of Edinburgh, to Mrs. Montagu.
At the splendid and hospitable mansion of this
celebrated lady, Beattie became acquainted with
various persons, both male and female, who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
then the chief ornaments of London society; and
he used to dwell with delight on the recollections
of her more private parties, made up of Lord
Lyttelton, Mrs. Carter, and a few others, who
spent their evenings in the most unreserved conversation
on literary, moral, or religious subjects.
From this time, Mrs. Montagu continued to be
one of his firmest friends; and their epistolary
correspondence closed only with her life. The
politeness and kindness of Hawkesworth, Armstrong,
Garrick, and Johnson, also contributed
much to render pleasant his visit to the metropolis.
Concerning the last illustrious man he writes
thus: "Johnson has been greatly misrepresented.
I have passed several entire days with him, and
found him extremely agreeable. The compliments
he pays to my writings are so high that I
have not the face to mention them." In December
Beattie had returned to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>In 1772, his mother died, at the advanced age
of fourscore, at the house of her affectionate son
David, in the neighbourhood of Laurencekirk.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April, 1773, Beattie, accompanied
by his wife, set out again for London.
This journey was undertaken partly for the sake
of his health and partly with a view to another
object&mdash;the bettering of his circumstances. The
emolument which he had derived from his writings
bore unfortunately no proportion to the fame he
had acquired; and the small income arising from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
his professorship afforded him the only means for
supporting his family. During his former visit
to the capital, in 1771, his English friends had
been very desirous to procure for him some permanent
provision; and it was well known that
his Majesty had expressed approbation of his
writings, and had even declared his intention of
conferring some reward on the man who had
laboured so successfully to advance the interests
of religion. With several important letters of
introduction&mdash;one addressed to the Earl of Dartmouth&mdash;he
now arrived in London, and was
cordially welcomed by Mrs. Montagu, and his
other friends. His reception by Lord Dartmouth
was kind and courteous: soon after which, being
summoned to wait on Lord North, he was told by
that minister that an early opportunity should be
taken to inform his Majesty of his arrival.</p>

<p>By some of his friends it had been suggested
that Beattie should take orders, and enter the
English church; but this mode of improving his
fortunes he very properly rejected.<a name="FNanchor_A_17" id="FNanchor_A_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> At
last, by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
the advice of the Archbishop of York, a memorial
was drawn up "expressing his services, his wants,
and his wishes;" which, having been transmitted
to Lord Dartmouth, was by him laid before the
King, who, on that occasion, spoke of Beattie and
his writings with high approbation, and signified
a desire to see him.</p>

<p>Meantime the number of our author's acquaintances
in the metropolis increased daily, and his
society was eagerly courted by a long list of illustrious
names. He now became personally known
to a distinguished churchman, with whom, during<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
the preceding year he had held some correspondence
by letter&mdash;Dr. Porteus, then Rector of
Lambeth, and finally Bishop of London; and the
friendship which took place between them was
sincere and lasting.</p>

<p>At the first levee, Beattie was presented by
Lord Dartmouth to his Majesty, who for several
minutes talked to him concerning his <i>Essay on
Truth</i> in the most condescending and affable
manner.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the University of Oxford, at
the installation of Lord North as its Chancellor,
conferred on our author a very flattering mark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>
of distinction, an honorary degree of Doctor of
Laws.</p>

<p>At length the object of his wishes was attained.
On the 20th of August, he received an official
letter from the secretary of Lord North, informing
him that the king had been pleased to allow him
a pension of two hundred pounds a year. Of the
private interview, with which, a few days after
he was honoured by their majesties, he has left
the following account in his Diary:</p>

<p>"Tuesday, 24th August, set out for Dr. Majendie's
at Kew-Green. The Doctor told me that
he had not seen the King yesterday, but had left
a note in writing, to intimate that I was to be at
his house to-day; and that one of the King's
pages had come to him this morning, to say 'that
his Majesty would see me a little after twelve.'
At twelve, the Doctor and I went to the King's
house, at Kew. We had been only a few minutes
in the hall, when the King and Queen came in
from an airing; and, as they passed through the
hall, the King called to me by name, and asked
how long it was since I came from town. I
answered, about an hour. 'I shall see you,'
says he, 'in a little.' The Doctor and I waited
a considerable time (for the King was busy),
and then we were called into a large room,
furnished as a library, where the King was walking
about, and the Queen sitting in a chair. We
were received in the most gracious manner pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>sible
by both their Majesties. I had the honour
of a conversation with them (nobody else being
present but Dr. Majendie) for upwards of an
hour, on a great variety of topics; in which both
the King and Queen joined, with a degree of
cheerfulness, affability, and ease, that was to me
surprising, and soon dissipated the embarrassment
which I felt at the beginning of the conference.
They both complimented me, in the
highest terms, on my 'Essay,' which, they said,
was a book they always kept by them; and the
King said he had one copy of it at Kew, and
another in town, and immediately went and took
it down from a shelf. I found it was the second
edition. 'I never stole a book but one,' said his
Majesty, 'and that was yours (speaking to me);
I stole it from the Queen, to give it to Lord
Hertford to read.' He had heard that the sale
of Hume's 'Essays' had failed, since my book
was published; and I told him what Mr. Strahan
had told me, in regard to that matter. He had
even heard of my being in Edinburgh last summer,
and how Mr. Hume was offended on the
score of my book. He asked many questions
about the second part of the 'Essay,' and when
it would be ready for the press. I gave him, in
a short speech, an account of the plan of it; and
said, my health was so precarious, I could not
tell when it might be ready, as I had many books
to consult before I could finish it; but, that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>
my health were good, I thought I might bring it
to a conclusion in two or three years. He asked,
how long I had been in composing my Essay?
praised the caution with which it was written;
and said, he did not wonder that it had employed
me five or six years. He asked about my poems.
I said, there was only one poem of my own on
which I set any value (meaning the 'Minstrel,')
and that it was first published about the same
time with the 'Essay.' My other poems, I said,
were incorrect, being but juvenile pieces, and of
little consequence, even in my own opinion.
We had much conversation on moral subjects;
from which both their Majesties let it appear
that they were warm friends to Christianity; and
so little inclined to infidelity, that they could
hardly believe that any thinking man could really
be an atheist, unless he could bring himself to
believe that he made himself; a thought which
pleased the King exceedingly; and he repeated
it several times to the Queen. He asked, whether
any thing had been written against me. I
spoke of the late pamphlet, of which I gave an
account, telling him, that I never had met with
any man who had read it, except one Quaker.
This brought on some discourse about the Quakers,
whose moderation and mild behaviour the
King and Queen commended. I was asked many
questions about the Scots universities; the revenues
of the Scots clergy; their mode of praying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>
and preaching; the medical college of Edinburgh;
Dr. Gregory (of whom I gave a particular character),
and Dr. Cullen; the length of our vacation
at Aberdeen, and the closeness of our attendance
during the winter; the number of students
that attend my lectures; my mode of lecturing,
whether from notes, or completely written lectures;
about Mr. Hume, and Dr. Robertson, and Lord
Kinnoull, and the Archbishop of York, &amp;c. &amp;c.
&amp;c. His Majesty asked what I thought of my
new acquaintance, Lord Dartmouth? I said there
was something in his air and manner which I
thought not only agreeable, but enchanting, and
that he seemed to me to be one of the best of
men; a sentiment in which both their Majesties
heartily joined. 'They say that Lord Dartmouth
is an enthusiast,' said the King, 'but surely he
says nothing on the subject of religion, but what
every Christian may, and ought to say.' He asked,
whether I did not think the English language
on the decline at present? I answered in the
affirmative; and the King agreed, and named the
'Spectator' as one of the best standards of the
language. When I told him that the Scots clergy
sometimes prayed a quarter, or even half an hour
at a time, he asked whether that did not lead them
into repetitions? I said, it often did. 'That,'
said he, 'I don't like in prayers; and excellent as
our liturgy is, I think it somewhat faulty in that
respect.' 'Your majesty knows,' said I, 'that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>
three services are joined in one in the ordinary
church service, which is one cause of those repetitions.'
'True,' he replied, 'and that circumstance
also makes the service too long.' From this he
took occasion to speak of the composition of the
church liturgy; on which he very justly bestowed
the highest commendation. 'Observe,' his
Majesty said, 'how flat those occasional prayers
are, that are now composed, in comparison with
the old ones.' When I mentioned the smallness
of the church livings in Scotland, he said, 'he wondered
how men of liberal education would choose
to become clergymen there;' and asked, 'whether
in the remote parts of the country, the clergy, in
general were not very ignorant?' I answered,
'No, for that education was very cheap in Scotland,
and that the clergy, in general, were men of
good sense, and competent learning.' He asked
whether we had any good preachers at Aberdeen?
I said, yes, and named Campbell and Gerard,
with whose names, however, I did not find that he
was acquainted. Dr. Majendie mentioned Dr.
Oswald's 'Appeal' with commendation; I praised
it too and the queen took down the name, with a
view to send for it. I was asked, whether I knew
Dr. Oswald? I answered, I did not; and said,
that my book was published before I read his;
that Dr. O. was well known to Lord Kinnoull,
who had often proposed to make us acquainted.
We discussed a great many other topics; for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>
conversation, as before observed, lasted for upwards
of an hour, without any intermission. The
Queen bore a large share in it. Both the King
and her Majesty showed a great deal of good sense,
acuteness, and knowledge, as well as of good nature
and affability. At last the king took out his
watch (for it was now almost three o'clock, his
hour of dinner), which Dr. Majendie and I took
as a signal to withdraw. We accordingly bowed
to their Majesties, and I addressed the King in
these words: 'I hope, Sir, your Majesty will
pardon me, if I take this opportunity to return
you my humble and most grateful acknowledgments,
for the honour you have been pleased to
confer upon me.' He immediately answered, 'I
think I could do no less for a man who has done
so much service to the cause of Christianity. I
shall always be glad of an opportunity to show
the good opinion I have of you.' The Queen
sate all the while, and the King stood, sometimes
walking about a little. Her Majesty speaks the
English language with surprising elegance, and
little or nothing of a foreign accent. There is
something wonderfully captivating in her manner;
so that if she were only of the rank of a
private gentlewoman, one could not help taking
notice of her, as one of the most agreeable women
in the world. Her face is much more pleasing
than any of her pictures; and in the expression
of her eyes, and in her smile, there is something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
peculiarly engaging. When the Doctor and I
came out, 'Pray,' said I, 'how did I behave?
Tell me honestly, for I am not accustomed to
conversations of this kind.' 'Why, perfectly well,'
answered he, 'and just as you ought to do.' 'Are
you sure of that?' said I. 'As sure,' he replied,
'as of my own existence: and you may be assured
of it too, when I tell you, that if there had been
any thing in your manner or conversation which
was not perfectly agreeable, your conference
would have been at an end in eight or ten minutes
at most.' The Doctor afterwards told me,
that it was a most uncommon thing for a private
man, and a commoner, to be honoured with so
long an audience. I dined with Dr. and Mrs.
Majendie, and their family, and returned to town
in the evening, very much pleased with the occurrences
of the day."</p>

<p>At this time, Sir Joshua Reynolds, having requested
Beattie to sit for his picture, produced
a likeness of him, which is generally regarded as
one of the finest works of that admirable artist.
He is represented in his Oxford gown of Doctor
of Laws, with his famous Essay under his arm;
while beside him is Truth, habited as an Angel,
holding in one hand a pair of scales, and with
the other thrusting down three frightful figures,
emblematic of Prejudice, Scepticism, and Folly.<a name="FNanchor_A_18" id="FNanchor_A_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>Of this picture Sir Joshua made a present to
Beattie, who set a due value on so noble a composition,
and preserved it with the utmost care.</p>

<p>After an absence of a little more than five
months, he returned to Aberdeen.</p>

<p>A striking proof how highly the character and
talents of Beattie were appreciated, even by those
to whom he was personally unknown, occurred in
October of this year (1773), when the chair of
Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh
was offered to him by the electors, the magistrates
of the city. He, however, declined accepting it,
"Though my fortune" (he writes to Sir William
Forbes, on the subject) "were as narrow now as
it lately was, I should still incline rather to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span>main
in quiet where I am, than, by becoming a
member of the University of Edinburgh, to place
myself within the reach of those (few as they are)
who have been pleased to let the world know that
they do not wish me well." He alludes to the
enemies whom his <i>Essay on Truth</i> had raised up.</p>

<p>The Second Book of <i>The Minstrel</i>, together
with a new and corrected edition of the First,
appeared in 1774, the author's name being now
added. The poem, thus enlarged, suffered no
diminution of its popularity.</p>

<p>The following year, Beattie and his wife spent
several weeks in London, residing during the
chief part of the time with Dr. Porteus, one of
his kindest and most zealous friends. On this
occasion, having shown himself at court, he was
immediately recognized by the King, who spoke to
him very graciously, and made several inquiries
concerning his studies.</p>

<p>To a new and improved edition in quarto, of
the <i>Essay on Truth</i>, printed by subscription,<a name="FNanchor_A_19" id="FNanchor_A_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span>
1776, our author appended three other Essays:
<i>On Poetry and Music, as they affect the Mind</i>,
<i>On Laughter and Ludicrous Composition</i>, and
<i>On the Utility of Classical Learning</i>. In 1777,<a name="FNanchor_B_20" id="FNanchor_B_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>
he gave to the press a new edition of <i>The Minstrel</i>,
to which he added a few of his minor poems:
this volume (he says in the preface) contains
"all the verses of which I am willing to be
considered as the author." In 1778,<a name="FNanchor_C_21" id="FNanchor_C_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> he printed
for private circulation a <i>Letter to Dr. Blair, on
the improvement of Psalmody in Scotland</i>. In
1779, he published, for the use of the young men
who attended his Lectures, a <i>List of Scotticisms</i>,
to the amount of about two hundred. And in
1780, he contributed some thoughts <i>On Dreaming</i>
to the well known periodical paper, <i>The Mirror</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span></p>
<p>The following portion of a letter from Dr.
Johnson to Beattie shows how sincerely our
author was esteemed by the great moralist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Bolt Court, Fleet Street, 21st August, 1780.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"More years than I have any delight to reckon
have past since you and I saw one another. Of
this, however, there is no reason for making any
reprehensory complaint, <i>sic fata ferunt</i>: but, methinks,
there might pass some small interchange
of regard between us. If you say that I ought
to have written, I now write; and I write to tell
you, that I have much kindness for you and Mrs.
Beattie, and that I wish your health better, and
your life long. Try change of air, and come a
few degrees southward; a softer climate may do
you both good. Winter is coming on, and London
will be warmer, and gayer, and busier, and more
fertile of amusement than Aberdeen."</p>
</div>

<p>In 1781, Beattie made another journey to
London, taking with him his eldest son, James
Hay Beattie.<a name="FNanchor_A_22" id="FNanchor_A_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> While there, we find him writing
thus to Sir William Forbes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"1st June.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"I have been visiting all my friends again and
again, and found them as affectionate and attentive
as ever. Death has indeed deprived me of some
since I was last here, of Garrick, and Armstrong,
and poor Harry Smith; but I have still many
left."... "Johnson grows in grace as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>
grows in years. He not only has better health
and a fresher complexion than ever he had before
(at least since I knew him), but he has
contracted a gentleness of manners which pleases
every body."</p>

<p class="ralign"><small>
"28th June.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"I thought it my duty to appear at the levee
before I left London; and accordingly the week
before last I went to court. The king had not
seen me for six years, and yet, to my surprise,
knew me at first sight. He spoke to me with his
wonted condescension and affability; and paid me
a very polite compliment on the subject of my
writings."</p>
</div>

<p>His <i>Dissertations, Moral and Critical</i>, were
published in 1783.</p>

<p>A passage from a letter of the poet Cowper to
the Rev. William Unwin, 5th April, 1784,<a name="FNanchor_A_23" id="FNanchor_A_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> must
not be omitted here:</p>

<p>"If you have not his poem, called the 'The
Minstrel,' and cannot borrow it, I must beg you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>
to buy it for me; for, though I cannot afford to
deal largely in so expensive a commodity as
books, I must afford to purchase at least the
poetical works of Beattie."</p>

<p>His health impaired, and his peace of mind
destroyed, by the melancholy condition of his
wife (who, labouring under confirmed insanity,
was now removed from her family), we need not
wonder that Beattie should endeavour to forget
his domestic griefs in the society of his English
friends, to whom he was ever welcome. During
the year 1784, after passing some time in London,
he spent a month with Dr. Porteus (who had
now attained the rank of Bishop of Chester), at
the beautiful parsonage of Hunton, near Maidstone,
which he characterizes as "the mansion of
peace, piety, and cheerfulness." He also visited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>
Mrs. Montagu, at her seat, called Sandleford, in
Berks.</p>

<p>In 1786, his <i>Evidences of the Christian Religion</i>,
were published. A remark which he makes
in a letter, while engaged in the composition of
this judicious summary, is worth quoting: "Whether
this work shall ever be of use to others, I
know not; but this I know, that it has been of
considerable benefit to myself. For though, when
I entered upon it, I understood my subject well
enough to entertain no doubt of the goodness of
my cause, yet I find, as I advance, new light
continually breaking in upon me."</p>

<p>The receipt of the following letter could hardly
fail to gratify our author:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Philadelphia, 1st August, 1786.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> American revolution, which divided the
British empire, made no breach in the republic
of letters. As a proof of this, a stranger to your
person, and a citizen of a country lately hostile
to yours, has expressed his obligations to you for
the knowledge and pleasure he has derived from
your excellent writings by procuring your admission
into the American Philosophical Society;
a certificate of which, subscribed by our illustrious
president, Dr. Franklin, and the other
officers of the society, you will receive by the
next vessel that sails to any port in North Britain
from this city.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span></p>

<p>"The stranger alluded to finished his studies
in medicine in Edinburgh in the year 1769, and
has ever since taught chemistry and medicine in
the college of Philadelphia. His name (with the
greatest respect for yours) is,</p>

<p class="ralign">
"<span class="smcap">Benjamin Rush</span>."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The next year, with his eldest son for his companion,
he repaired again to London. While
there, he writes thus to his niece, Miss Valentine,
now Mrs. Glennie:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"London, 20th July, 1787.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">I am</span> just returned from Windsor, where I
passed three days. I went thither, partly to see
some friends, but chiefly that I might pay my
respects to the King and Queen. They both received
me in the most gracious manner. I saw
the King first on the terrace, where he knew me
at first sight, and did me the honour to converse
with me a considerable time. Next morning I
saw him again at prayers in his chapel, where he
was pleased to introduce me to the Queen, who
inquired very kindly after my health; observed,
that many years had passed since she saw me
last; regretted the bad weather which I had met
with at Windsor (for it rained incessantly,) which,
said she, has made your friends see less of you
than they wished; and, after some other conversation,
her Majesty and the Princess Elizabeth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>
who attended her, made a slight courtesy, and
stepped into the carriage that waited for them at
the chapel door. The King remained with us
for some time longer, and talked of various matters."</p>
</div>

<p>Our author then proceeded to visit Dr. Porteus
at Hunton, and Mrs. Montagu at Sandleford, but
was obliged to quit the latter place sooner than
he had intended, on account of the illness of his
son, who shewed symptoms of that consumptive
complaint to which he afterwards fell a victim.
For the sake of medical advice Beattie carried
him back to the metropolis, and from thence, by
very easy stages, to Aberdeen. Soon after his
return to Scotland, the invalid improved so much
in health that he was able to take upon him
part of the management of the class of Moral
Philosophy in the Marischal College, having been
appointed in June of this year (when he was not
quite nineteen) assistant professor to his father.</p>

<p>In 1790, Beattie put forth the first volume of his
<i>Elements of Moral Science</i>; and superintended
an edition of Addison's Periodical Papers, adding
a few notes to Tickell's Life of that author, and
to Johnson's Remarks on his Prose Writings.
The second volume of the <i>Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh</i>, published during
this year, contains 'Remarks on some Passages of

<p>He had now to suffer the dire bereavement
which he had long foreseen, the loss of his eldest
son, the object of his fondest affection. He thus
informs the Duchess of Gordon of the melancholy
event:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Aberdeen, 1st December, 1790.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Knowing</span> with what kindness and condescension
your grace takes an interest in every thing
that concerns me and my little family, I take the
liberty to inform you, that my son James is dead;
that the last duties to him are now paid; and
that I am endeavouring to return, with the little
ability that is left me, and with entire submission
to the will of Providence, to the ordinary business
of life. I have lost one who was always a pleasing
companion; but who, for the last five or six
years, was one of the most entertaining and
instructive companions that ever man was blest
with: for his mind comprehended almost every
science; he was a most attentive observer of life
and manners; a master of classical learning;
and he possessed an exuberance of wit and humour,
a force of understanding, and a correctness
and delicacy of taste, beyond any other
person of his age I have ever known.</p>

<p>"He was taken ill in the night of the 30th of
November, 1789; and from that time his decline
commenced. It was long what physicians call a
nervous atrophy; but towards the end of June,
symptoms began to appear of the lungs being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
affected. Goats' milk, and afterwards asses' milk,
were procured for him in abundance; and such
exercise as he could bear, he regularly took;
these means lengthened his days no doubt, and
alleviated his sufferings, which indeed were not
often severe: but, in spite of all that could be
done, he grew weaker and weaker, and died the
19th of November, 1790, without complaint or
pain, without even a groan or a sigh; retaining
to the last moment the use of his rational faculties;
indeed, from first to last, not one delirious
word ever escaped him. He lived twenty-two
years and thirteen days. Many weeks before it
came, he saw death approaching, and he met it
with such composure and pious resignation, as
may no doubt be equalled, but cannot be surpassed.</p>

<p>"He has left many things in writing, serious
and humorous, scientific and miscellaneous, prose
and verse, Latin and English; but it will be a
long time before I shall be able to harden my
heart so far as to revise them."</p>
</div>

<p>In April of the following year, Beattie again
travelled southwards, accompanied by Montagu,<a name="FNanchor_A_24" id="FNanchor_A_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a>
his second son and only surviving child. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
remained some weeks in Edinburgh, and then
journeyed slowly to London, which after a short
stay they quitted for the summer residence of Dr.
Porteus, who was now elevated to the see of the
metropolis. The tranquillity of Fulham Palace,
and the kind attentions of its inhabitants, contributed
greatly to amend the health and raise
the spirits of our author; and he seems to have
enjoyed the company of the distinguished persons
with whom he had an opportunity of associating.
"Last week," he writes to Sir William Forbes,
30th June, 1791, "I made a morning visit to
Mr. Pitt. I had heard him spoken of as a grave
and reserved man; but saw nothing of it. He
gave me a very frank, and indeed affectionate
reception; and was so cheerful, and in his conversation
so easy, that I almost thought myself
in the company rather of an old acquaintance
than of a great statesman. He was pleased to
pay me some very obliging compliments, asked
about my health, and how I meant to pass the
summer; spoke of the Duchess of Gordon, the
improvements of Edinburgh, and various other
matters: and when I told him, I knew not what
apology to make for intruding upon him, said,
that no apology was necessary, for that he was
very glad to see me, and desired to see me again."
Before returning to Scotland, the travellers went
to Bath, and from thence to Sandleford, the seat
of Mrs. Montagu.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span></p>

<p>The second volume of the <i>Elements of Moral
Science</i> appeared in 1793. During the same
year the sudden death of his favourite sister,
Mrs. Valentine, increased the domestic sorrows
of Beattie. His health was at this period so
greatly impaired, that being unable to attend to
his duties of Professor in the Marischal College,
he engaged his old pupil, Mr. Glennie, as an assistant:
occasionally, however, he continued to lecture
to his class till the commencement of the
winter session of 1797.</p>

<p>For some time past he had occupied himself in
the melancholy yet pleasing task of editing a volume
of the compositions of his eldest son. From
a pardonable partiality for the writings of a beloved
child, and from his not very accurate
attainments in classical scholarship, he admitted
into the collection several pieces, both English
and Latin, which fall considerably below mediocrity.
A few copies of the work were privately
printed in 1794, under the title of <i>Essays and
Fragments in Prose and Verse, by James Hay
Beattie</i>, and were "offered as presents to those
friends with whom the author was particularly
acquainted or connected."<a name="FNanchor_A_25" id="FNanchor_A_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> Though it undoubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>edly
shows that the deceased was a young man
of uncommon quickness of talent, and the most
indefatigable application, it exhibits nothing which
has a claim to be considered as the offspring
of genius.<a name="FNanchor_B_25" id="FNanchor_B_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_25" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> The most interesting portion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg lxiv]</a></span>
volume is the biographical sketch prefixed to it
by the afflicted father, a memoir of exquisite
simplicity and pathos. The account given by
Beattie of the method which he adopted in im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>parting
to his son the first idea of a Supreme
Being is too striking to be omitted here:</p>

<p>"The doctrines of religion I wished to impress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
on his mind, as soon as it might be prepared to
receive them; but I did not see the propriety
of making him commit to memory theological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
sentences, or any sentences which it was not possible
for him to understand. And I was desirous
to make a trial how far his own reason could go
in tracing out, with a little direction, the great
and first principle of all religion, the being of
God. The following fact is mentioned, not as a
proof of superior sagacity in him (for I have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>
doubt that most children would in like circumstances
think as he did), but merely as a moral
or logical experiment: He had reached his fifth
(or sixth) year, knew the alphabet, and could
read a little; but had received no particular
information with respect to the Author of his
being; because I thought he could not yet understand
such information; and because I had
learned, from my own experience, that to be
made to repeat words not understood is extremely
detrimental to the faculties of a young mind. In
a corner of a little garden, without informing any
person of the circumstance, I wrote in the mould,
with my finger, the three initial letters of his
name; and sowing garden-cresses in the furrows,
covered up the seed, and smoothed the ground.
Ten days after, he came running to me, and with
astonishment in his countenance, told me that his
name was growing in the garden. I smiled at
the report, and seemed inclined to disregard it;
but he insisted on my going to see what had
happened. Yes, said I carelessly, on coming to
the place, I see it is so; but there is nothing in
this worth notice; it is mere chance; and I went
away. He followed me and taking hold of my
coat, said, with some earnestness, It could not be
mere chance; for that somebody must have contrived
matters so as to produce it.&mdash;I pretend not
to give his words, or my own, for I have forgotten
both; but I give the substance of what passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>
between us in such language as we both understood.&mdash;So
you think, I said, that what appears
so regular as the letters of your name, cannot be
by chance. Yes, said he, with firmness, I think
so. Look at yourself, I replied, and consider
your hands and fingers, your legs and feet, and
other limbs; are not they regular in their appearance,
and useful to you? He said, they
were. Came you then hither, said I, by chance?
No, he answered, that cannot be; something
must have made me. And who is that something?
I asked. He said he did not know. (I
took particular notice, that he did not say, as
Rousseau fancies a child in like circumstances
would say, that his parents made him.) I had
now gained the point I aimed at, and saw that
his reason taught him (though he could not so
express it) that what begins to be must have a
cause, and that what is formed with regularity
must have an intelligent cause. I therefore told
him the name of the Great Being who made him
and all the world; concerning whose adorable
nature I gave him such information as I thought
he could in some measure comprehend. The
lesson affected him greatly, and he never forgot
either it, or the circumstance that introduced it."</p>

<p>After the loss of this highly-gifted youth, the
only tie which bound Beattie to the world was his
second son, who, though far inferior to the deceased
in learning, was endowed with no ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>
talents.<a name="FNanchor_A_36" id="FNanchor_A_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_36" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a> Just as our author was anxiously
forming plans for his future establishment in
life, Montagu was unexpectedly carried off by a
fever of only a few days' continuance, in the
eighteenth year of his age. Beattie thus communicates
to Sir William Forbes the intelligence
of his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ralign"><small>
"Aberdeen, 14th March, 1796.<br />
</small></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Our</span> plans relating to Montagu are all at an
end. I am sorry to give you the pain of being
informed, that he died this morning at five. His
disorder was a fever, from which at first we had
little apprehension; but it cut him off in five
days. He himself thought from the beginning
that it would be fatal; and, before the delirium
came on, spoke with great composure and Christian
piety of his approaching dissolution: he even
gave some directions about his funeral. The delirium
was very violent, and continued till within
a few minutes of his death, when he was heard to
repeat in a whisper the Lord's prayer, and began
an unfinished sentence, of which nothing could
be heard but the words <i>incorruptible glory</i>. Pious
sentiments prevailed in his mind through life, and
did not leave him till death; nor then, I trust, did
they leave him. Notwithstanding the extreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>
violence of his fever, he seemed to suffer little
pain, either in body or in mind, and as his end
drew near, a smile settled upon his countenance.
I need not tell you that he had every attention
that skilful and affectionate physicians could bestow.
I give you the trouble to notify this event
to Mr. Arbuthnot. I would have written to him,
but have many things to mind, and but indifferent
health. However, I heartily acquiesce in the
dispensations of Providence, which are all good
and wise. God bless you and your family.</p>

<p>"He will be much regretted; for wherever he
went he was a very popular character."</p>
</div>

<p>Such an effect had this fresh calamity on the
intellectual powers of Beattie, that a few days
after Montagu's death, he experienced a temporary
hut almost utter loss of memory respecting
him. Having searched every room in the house,
he would say to his niece, Mrs. Glennie, "You
may think it strange, but I must ask you if I
have a son, and where he is?" She then felt
herself under the painful necessity of calling to
his recollection the sufferings of Montagu, the
mention of which never failed to restore him to
reason. Often with tears he would declare himself
thankful that his children were in the grave,
exclaiming, in allusion to their mother's malady,
"How could I have borne to see their elegant
minds mangled with madness!" On viewing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>
dead body of Montagu for the last time, he said,
"I have now done with the world."</p>

<p>The following passages from two of his letters,
written about this period, are deeply affecting.
He tells the Rev. Dr. Laing, 10th April, 1796:</p>

<p>"I hope I am resigned, as my duty requires,
and as I wish to be; but I have passed many a
bitter hour, though on those occasions nobody
sees me. I fear my reason is a little disordered,
for I have sometimes thought of late, especially
in a morning, that Montagu is not dead, though
I seem to have a remembrance of a dream that
he is. This you will say, what I myself believe,
is a symptom not uncommon in cases similar to
mine, and that I ought by all means to go from
home as soon as I can. I will do so when the
weather becomes tolerable."</p>

<p>To Sir William Forbes he says, 17th of the
same month:</p>

<p>"I have been these many days resolving to
write to you and Mr. Arbuthnot, to thank you
for your very kind and sympathetic letters, but
various things have come in my way to prevent
it. I need not pretend a hurry of business, for
every-body knows I am not capable of any. A
deep gloom hangs upon me, and disables all
my faculties; and thoughts so strange sometimes
occur to me as to make me 'fear that I am not,'
as Lear says, 'in my perfect mind.' But I thank
God I am entirely resigned to the divine will;
and, though I am now childless, I have friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg lxxiii]</a></span>
whose goodness to me, and other virtues, I find
great comfort in recollecting. The physicians
not only advise, but entreat, and indeed command
me to go from home, and that without further
delay; and I do seriously resolve to set out for
Edinburgh to-morrow."</p>

<p>Though Beattie never from henceforth engaged
in any kind of study, he still found some enjoyment
in books, and still derived some pleasure
from the society of a very few of his oldest friends.
He almost entirely ceased to correspond, even
with those whom he most valued; yet when he
happened to receive a letter from any of them,
his spirits were always excited for the rest of the
day. Music, in which he had once delighted,
had become disagreeable to him since the loss
of his eldest son.<a name="FNanchor_A_37" id="FNanchor_A_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_37" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> A few months, however, before
Montagu's death, he had occasionally played
an accompaniment while Montagu sung; but now,
when prevailed on to resume his favourite violoncello,
he was always dissatisfied with his own
performance. "My fingers," he writes to the Rev.
Dr. Laing, 5th June, 1798, "have not strength to
press down the strings."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>In this state he continued till the beginning
of April, 1799, when he was struck with palsy,
which, for eight days, rendered him nearly incapable
of utterance. At different times the
disease repeated its attacks, the last of which, on
the 5th of October, 1802, deprived him entirely
of the power of motion. On the morning of the
18th of August, 1803, he expired without a
struggle, in the sixty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>His remains were laid, according to his own
desire, beside those of his children, in the church-yard
of St. Nicholas, at Aberdeen; and a Latin
inscription, from the pen of the late Dr. James
Gregory, of Edinburgh, marks the spot of his
interment.</p>

<p>In person he was of the middle size, of a broad,
square make, which seemed to indicate a more
robust constitution than he really possessed. In
his gait there was something of a slouch. During
his later years he grew corpulent and unwieldy;
but a few months before his death his hulk was
greatly diminished. His features were very regular;
his complexion somewhat dark. His eyes
were black, brilliant, full of a tender and melancholy
expression, and, in the course of conversation
with his friends, became extremely animated.</p>

<p>Though I am of opinion with Gilbert Wakefield,
that the maxim <i>De mortuis nil nisi</i> <span class="smcap">VERUM</span> is
better than <i>De mortuis nil nisi</i> <span class="smcap">BONUM</span>, it is with
pain that I touch on the reported failing of so truly
good a man as Beattie. It has been asserted that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>
towards the close of life he indulged to excess in
the use of wine. In a letter to Mr. Arbuthnot,
he says, "With the present pressure upon my
mind, I should not be able to sleep, if I did not
use wine as an opiate; it is less hurtful than
laudanum, but not so effectual." He may, perhaps,
have had too frequent recourse to so palatable
a medicine, in the hope of banishing for a
while the recollection of his sorrows; and if, under
any circumstances, such a fault is to be regarded
as venial, it may be excused in one who was a more
than widowed husband and a childless father.</p>

<p>The prose writings of Beattie appear of late
years to have fallen into disrepute; and the once
celebrated <i>Essay on Truth</i> is at present as much
undervalued as it was formerly overrated.</p>

<p>His fame now rests upon <i>The Minstrel</i> alone.
Since its first publication, many poems of a far
loftier and more original character have been produced
in England; yet still does it maintain its
popularity; and still in Edwin, that happy personification
of the poetic temperament, do young
and enthusiastic readers delight to recognize a
picture of themselves. Though we cannot fail to
regret that Beattie should have left it incomplete,
yet we do not long for the concluding books from
any interest which we take in the story, such as
is excited by some other unfinished works of genius,
the tale of <i>Cambuscan</i>, for instance, or the legend
of <i>Christabel</i>. In <i>The Minstrel</i>, indeed, there is
but little invention; it is a poem of sentiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>
and description, conveying to us lessons of true
philosophy in language of surpassing beauty, and
displaying pictures of nature, in her romantic
solitudes, painted by a master's hand. "On my
once asking Dr. Beattie," says Sir William Forbes,
"in what manner he had intended to employ his
Minstrel, had he completed his original design of
extending the poem to a third canto, he said, he
proposed to have introduced a foreign enemy as
invading his country, in consequence of which the
Minstrel was to employ himself in rousing his
countrymen to arms."<a name="FNanchor_A_38" id="FNanchor_A_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_38" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> But surely such a conclusion
would have formed too violent a contrast
to the repose of the earlier books; and the charm
which attaches us to the meditative Edwin, while
a wanderer among the lonely hills and groves,
would have been broken, or at least weakened,
by placing him amid the throng of warriors and
the din of arms.</p>

<p>With the exception of <i>The Hermit</i> and the following
exquisite stanza<a name="FNanchor_B_39" id="FNanchor_B_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_39" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> of <i>Retirement</i>, there is little
worthy of particular notice in the minor poems
of Beattie.</p>




<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> "At his leisure hours he cultivated the muses. A journal
kept by him, as well as some specimens of his poetry,
are still in the possession of his descendants. This last circumstance
is the more worthy of being noticed, as it proves
that Dr. Beattie derived his poetical turn from his father."&mdash;Bower's
<i>Life of Beattie</i>, 1804, p. 2.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> According to Bower, Beattie was supported at college
by the generosity of his brother David, who accompanied
him to Aberdeen, when he first quitted Laurencekirk to
commence his course at the University. "The peculiar
mode of their conveyance to Aberdeen is a matter of very
trifling moment. It may not be unacceptable to some,
however, to be informed, that they rode on one horse; and at a
season of the year not the most agreeable for undertaking a
journey (when good roads were unknown in Scotland) of
thirty English miles."&mdash;<i>Life of Beattie</i>, 1804, p. 17.</p></div>

the friend of Pope and Swift.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_8" id="Footnote_A_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Sir William Forbes says it "had a rapid sale." Mr.
A. Chalmers, however (<i>Poets</i>, vol. xviii. p. 519), doubts if
it was ever published for sale, except in Beattie's <i>Poems</i>, 1766,
in the Advertisement to which we are told that it "appeared
in a separate pamphlet in the beginning of the year 1765."
I have been unable to meet with the original edition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_9" id="Footnote_A_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> I have been told that the poem consisted originally of
only four stanzas, and that the two beautiful ones with which
it now concludes were added, a considerable time after the
others were written, at the request of Mrs. Carnegie, of Charlton,
near Montrose. This lady, whose maiden name was Scott,
was authoress of a poem called <i>Dunotter Castle</i>, printed in
the second edition of Colman and Thornton's <i>Poems by
Eminent Ladies</i>.
</p><p>
'Pentland Hills', for which Beattie wrote <i>The Hermit</i>, was
an air composed by Mr. Tytler, of Woodhouselee, in imitation
of the old Scottish melodies.</p></div>

China jars from the chimney-piece, and carefully arranged

opened it, they might fall upon his head.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_11" id="Footnote_A_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> Beattie's Verses were printed in the Aberdeen Journal,
together with an introductory letter in prose also by him,
signed "Oliver Oldstile." The writer of the Life of Ross,
in that pleasing compilation, <i>Lives of Scottish Poets</i>, 3 vols.
1822, says: "The author of both productions was generally
understood to be Dr. Beattie; and they have remained so
long ascribed to him without contradiction, that there can
be little doubt of their being from his pen." <i>Part</i> iii. p. 107.
There is no doubt about the matter; Beattie owns them in a
letter to Blacklock.&mdash;Forbes's <i>Life of Beattie</i>, vol. i. p. 153.

merit: to the second edition of it (and I believe to all subsequent

in that county worth &pound;150 per annum, the other from Dr.
Thomas, Bishop of Winchester, of a living in Hants, valued
at &pound;500 a year&mdash;neither of which he would accept. In the
letter wherein he declines the second noble offer, he thus
expresses himself:
</p><p>
"I wrote the 'Essays on Truth' with the certain prospect
of raising many enemies, with very faint hopes of attracting
the public attention, and without any views of advancing my
fortune. I published it, however, because I thought it might
probably do a little good, by bringing to nought, or, at least,
lessening the reputation of that wretched system of sceptical
philosophy, which had made a most alarming progress, and
done incredible mischief to this country. My enemies have
been at great pains to represent my views, in that publication,
as very different: and that my principal, or only motive was
to make a book, and, if possible, to raise myself higher in
the world. So that, if I were now to accept preferment in
the church, I should be apprehensive that I might strengthen
the hands of the gainsayer, and give the world some ground
to believe that my love of truth was not quite so ardent, or
so pure, as I had pretended.
</p><p>
"Besides, might it not have the appearance of levity and insincerity,
and, by some, be construed into a want of principle,
if I were, at these years (for I am now thirty-eight), to make
such an important change in my way of life, and to quit,
with no other <i>apparent</i> motive than that of bettering my
circumstances, that church of which I have hitherto been a
member? If my book has any tendency to do good, as I
flatter myself it has, I would not, for the wealth of the Indies,
do any thing to counteract that tendency; and I am afraid
that tendency might, in some measure be counteracted (at
least in this country) if I were to give the adversary the
least ground to charge me with inconsistency. It is true,
that the force of my reasonings cannot be <i>really</i> affected by
my character; truth is truth, whoever be the speaker; but
even truth itself becomes less respectable, when spoken, or
supposed to be spoken, by insincere lips.
</p><p>
"It has also been hinted to me, by several persons of very
sound judgment, that what I have written, or may hereafter
write in favour of religion, has a chance of being more
attended to, if I continue a layman, than if I were to become
a clergyman. Nor am I without apprehensions (though some
of my friends think them ill founded) that, from entering so
late in life, and from so remote a province, into the Church
of England, some degree of ungracefulness, particularly in
pronunciation, might adhere to my performances in public,
sufficient to render them less pleasing, and consequently less
useful."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_18" id="Footnote_A_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> So Beattie names the figures in one of his letters;
but Sir William Forbes tells us they are supposed to mean
Sophistry, Scepticism, and Infidelity. The worthy Baronet
proceeds to observe:
</p><p>
"Because one of these was a lean figure and the [an] other
a fat one, people of lively imaginations pleased themselves
with finding in them the portraits of Voltaire and Mr. Hume.
But Sir Joshua, I have reason to believe, had no such thought
when he painted those figures."
</p><p>
Surely Sir William had never read all the letters which he
printed in his <i>Life of Beattie</i>, for in vol. ii. p. 42, octavo ed.,
we find the great painter writing to our poet as follows, in
February, 1774:
</p><p>
"Mr. Hume has heard from somebody that he is introduced
in the picture, not much to his credit; there is only a figure,
covering his face with his hands, which they may call Hume
or any body else; <i>it is true it has a tolerable broad back. As
for Voltaire, I intended he should be one of the group.</i>"
</p><p>
This fine picture is now at Aberdeen, in the possession
of Beattie's niece, Mrs. Glennie.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_19" id="Footnote_A_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> When Beattie was in London, in 1773, and when it was
doubtful whether government would ever make any provision
for him, his friends there set on foot a subscription for this work.
"It was a thing," says he, in a letter to Lady Mayne, January,
1774, "of a private nature entirely; projected not by me,
but by some of my friends, who had condescended to charge
themselves with the whole trouble of it: it was never meant
to be made public, nor put into the hands of booksellers,
nor carried on by solicitation, but was to be considered as a
<i>voluntary</i> mark of the approbation of some persons of rank
and fortune, who wished it to be known that they patronized
me on account of what I had written in defence of truth,"
&amp;c. Prefixed to the volume is a list of nearly five hundred
subscribers, among whom are many distinguished characters
in church and state.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_20" id="Footnote_B_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> A spurious edition of his Juvenile Poems, with some
which he never wrote, from Dodsley's <i>Collection</i>, was put
forth in 1780. This volume he disowned in a public advertisement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_21" id="Footnote_C_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> Perhaps it was not printed till the beginning of the following
year. In a letter to Beattie, dated Feb. 1st, 1779, Mrs.
Montagu says, "I was much pleased with your pamphlet on
Psalmody."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_22" id="Footnote_A_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> He was born in 1768, and was named after James Hay,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_23" id="Footnote_A_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> Writing from Edinburgh, 28th May, 1784, to his niece,
Miss Valentine (now Mrs. Glennie), Beattie describes the
sensation caused in that city by the performances of Mrs.
Siddons. He says that he met her at the house of Lord
Buchan; that he played to her many Scotch airs on the
violoncello, with which she was much gratified; and that
"she sung 'Queen Mary's Complaint' to admiration, and I
had the honour to accompany her on the bass."&mdash;Forbes's
<i>Life of Beattie</i>, vol. ii. p. 324, octavo ed.
</p><p>
I am informed, by the incomparable actress in question,
that the quotation just given contains an utter falsehood,
which, when Forbes's Life of our author first appeared, in
1806, she read with astonishment. She remembers perfectly
having been introduced to Beattie at Lord Buchan's, but
she is quite certain she did <i>not</i> sing either Queen Mary's
Complaint or any other song; and she observes, that if she
<i>had</i> sung to his accompaniment, the circumstance would
have been so striking that it could not possibly have escaped
her recollection.
</p><p>
Qy. Has Beattie's letter been mutilated, the person who
transcribed it for the press having by mistake omitted some
lines? and do the words "she sung," in the concluding
sentence, refer to some other more musical lady, and not to
Mrs. Siddons?</p></div>

<p class="ralign"><small>
January, 1777.<br />
</small></p>

<p>Having lately seen in print some poems ascribed
to me which I never wrote, and some of my own
inaccurately copied, I thought it would not be
improper to publish, in this little volume, all the
verses of which I am willing to be considered as
the author. Many others I did indeed write in
the early part of my life; but they were in general
so incorrect, that I would not rescue them
from oblivion, even if a wish could do it.</p>

<p>Some of the few now offered to the Public
would perhaps have been suppressed, if in making
this collection I had implicitly followed my own
judgment. But in so small a matter, who would
refuse to submit his opinion to that of a friend?</p>

<p>It is of no consequence to the reader to know
the date of any of these little poems. But some
private reasons determined the author to add, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
most of them were written many years age, and
that the greatest part of the <span class="smcap">Minstrel</span>, which
is his latest attempt in this way, was composed in
the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight.</p>



<hr style="width: 85%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_MINSTREL" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_MINSTREL"></a>PREFACE TO THE MINSTREL.</h2>


<p>The design was to trace the progress of a Poetical
Genius, born in a rude age, from the first
dawning of fancy and reason, till that period at
which he may be supposed capable of appearing
in the world as a Minstrel, that is, as an itinerant
Poet and Musician;&mdash;a character which, according
to the notions of our forefathers, was not
only respectable, but sacred.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to imitate Spenser in the
measure of his verse, and in the harmony, simplicity,
and variety of his composition. Antique
expressions I have avoided; admitting, however,
some old words, where they seemed to suit the
subject; but I hope none will be found that are
now obsolete, or in any degree not intelligible to
a reader of English poetry.</p>

<p>To those who may be disposed to ask, what
could induce me to write in so difficult a measure,
I can only answer that it pleases my ear, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
seems, from its Gothic structure and original,
to bear some relation to the subject and spirit
of the Poem. It admits both simplicity and
magnificence of sound and of language beyond
any other stanza that I am acquainted with. It
allows the sententiousness of the couplet, as well
as the more complex modulation of blank verse.
What some critics have remarked, of its uniformity
growing at last tiresome to the ear, will
be found to hold true, only when the poetry is
faulty in other respects.</p>

<span class="ft60">WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1758.</span></h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still shall unthinking man substantial deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forms that fleet through life's deceitful dream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at some stroke of Fate the vision flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sad realities in prospect rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from Elysian slumbers rudely torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The startled soul awakes, to think, and mourn.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O ye, whose hours in jocund train advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose spirits to the song of gladness dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who flowery plains in endless pomp survey,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be rous'd to thought, anticipate the blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, like the lightning's glance, the sudden ill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lest, thus encompass'd with funereal gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me, ye bend o'er some untimely tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour your wild ravings in Night's frighted ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half pronounce Heaven's sacred doom severe.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wise, beauteous, good! O every grace combin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That charms the eye, or captivates the mind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh, as the floweret opening on the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaves bright drops of liquid pearl adorn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet, as the downy-pinion'd gale, that roves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather fragrance in Arabian groves!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mild, as the melodies at close of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, heard remote, along the vale decay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, why with these compar'd? What tints so fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What sweetness, mildness, can be match'd with thine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why roam abroad, since recollection true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restores the lovely form to fancy's view?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still let me gaze, and every care beguile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on that cheek, where all the Graces smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soul-expressing eye, benignly bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where meekness beams ineffable delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That brow, where wisdom sits enthron'd serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each feature forms, and dignifies the mien:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still let me listen, while her words impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet effusions of the blameless heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all my soul, each tumult charm'd away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yields, gently led, to Virtue's easy sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By thee inspir'd, O Virtue, age is young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And music warbles from the faltering tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy ray creative cheers the clouded brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And decks the faded cheek with rosy glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightens the joyless aspect, and supplies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure heavenly lustre to the languid eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when youth's living bloom reflects thy beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resistless on the view the glory streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, wonder, joy, alternately alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beauty dazzles with angelic charm.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, whither fled! ye dear illusions stay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, pale and silent lies the lovely clay.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Health on her form each sprightly grace bestow'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With life and thought each speaking feature glow'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair was the blossom, soft the vernal sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elate with hope, we deem'd no tempest nigh:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, a whirlwind's instantaneous gust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left all its beauties withering in the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Cold the soft hand, that sooth'd Woe's weary head!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quench'd the eye, the pitying tear that shed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mute the voice, whose pleasing accents stole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Infusing balm, into the rankled soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Death, why arm with cruelty thy power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spare the idle weed, yet lop the flower!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why fly thy shafts in lawless error driven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Virtue then no more the care of Heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But peace, bold thought! be still, my bursting heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, not Eliza, felt the fatal dart.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Escap'd the dungeon, does the slave complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bless the friendly hand that broke the chain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, pines not Virtue for the lingering morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this dark wild condemn'd to roam forlorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Reason's meteor-rays, with sickly glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclosing dubious to th' affrighted eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erwhelming mountains tottering from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black billowy deeps in storms perpetual toss'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weary ways in wildering labyrinths lost?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O happy stroke, that bursts the bonds of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darts through the rending gloom the blaze of day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dangers threat, and fears alarm no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Transporting thought! here let me wipe away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tear of grief, and wake a bolder lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! the swimming eye o'erflows anew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor check the sacred drops to pity due:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, where in speechless, hopeless anguish, bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er her lov'd dust, the parent, brother, friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How vain the hope of man! but cease thy strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sorrow's dread solemnity profane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mix'd with yon drooping mourners, on her bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence shed the sympathetic tear.<br /></span>

<span class="ft60">FROM THE PYGM&AElig;O-GERANO-MACHIA OF ADDISON.</span></h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The pigmy-people, and the feather'd train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling in mortal combat on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sing. Ye Muses, favour my designs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead on my squadrons, and arrange the lines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flashing swords and fluttering wings display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long bills nibbling in the bloody fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cranes darting with disdain on tiny foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conflicting birds and men, and war's unnumber'd woes.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wars and woes of heroes six feet long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have oft resounded in Pierian song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not heard of Colchos' golden fleece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Argo mann'd with all the flower of Greece?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Thebes' fell brethren, Theseus stern of face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Peleus' son, unrivall'd in the race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;neas, founder of the Roman line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And William, glorious on the banks of Boyne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not learn'd to weep at Pompey's woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over Blackmore's epic page to doze?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis I, who dare attempt unusual strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hosts unsung, and unfrequented plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The small shrill trump, and chiefs of little size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And armies rushing down the darken'd skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where India reddens to the early dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds a deep vale from vulgar eye withdrawn;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bosom'd in groves the lowly region lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rocky mountains round the border rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, till the doom of fate its fall decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The empire flourish'd of the pigmy-breed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Industry perform'd, and Genius plann'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy multitudes o'erspread the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now to these lone bounds if pilgrim stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempting through craggy cliffs the desperate way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds the puny mansion fallen to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its godlings mouldering on th' abandon'd hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starts, where small white bones are spread around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Or little footsteps lightly print the ground;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the proud crane her nest securely builds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chattering amid the desolated fields.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But different fates befell her hostile rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While reign'd, invincible through many an age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreaded pigmy: rous'd by war's alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth rush'd the madding manikin to arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce to the field of death the hero flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faint crane fluttering flaps the ground, and dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the victor borne (o'erwhelming load!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody bill loose-dangling marks the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft the wily dwarf in ambush lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often made the callow young his prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slaughter'd victims heap'd his board, and smil'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T' avenge the parent's trespass on the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, where his feather'd foe had rear'd her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid her eggs and household gods to rest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning for blood, in terrible array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eighteen-inch militia burst their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All went to wreck; the infant foeman fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When scarce his chirping bill had broke the shell.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Loud uproar hence, and rage of arms arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fell rancour of encountering foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence dwarfs and cranes one general havoc whelms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death's grim visage scares the pigmy-realms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not half so furious blaz'd the warlike fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mice, high theme of the Meonian lyre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When bold to battle march'd the accoutred frogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep tumult thunder'd through the bogs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierc'd by the javelin bulrush on the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here agonizing roll'd the mouse in gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the frog, (a scene full sad to see!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shorn of one leg, slow sprawl'd along on three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He vaults no more with vigorous hops on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mourns in hoarsest croaks his destiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now the day of woe drew on apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A day of woe to all the pigmy-race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dwarfs were doom'd (but penitence was vain)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rue each broken egg, and chicken slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, roused to vengeance by repeated wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From distant climes the long-bill'd legions throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Strymon's lake, Cayster's plashy meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fens of Scythia, green with rustling reeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From where the Danube winds through many a land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mareotis laves th' Egyptian strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rendezvous they waft on eager wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wait assembled the returning spring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile they trim their plumes for length of flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whet their keen beaks and twisting claws for fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each crane the pigmy power in thought o'erturns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every bosom for the battle burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When genial gales the frozen air unbind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The screaming legions wheel, and mount the wind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the sky they form their long array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And land and ocean stretch'd immense survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep deep beneath: and, triumphing in pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clouds and winds commix'd, innumerous ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis wild obstreperous clangour all, and heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirls in tempestuous undulation driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor less th' alarm that shook the world below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where march'd in pomp of war th' embattled foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where manikins with haughty step advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grasp the shield, and couch the quivering lance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right and left the lengthening lines they form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rank'd in deep array await the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High in the midst the chieftain-dwarf was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of giant stature, and imperial mien:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full twenty inches tall he strode along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view'd with lofty eye the wondering throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while with many a scar his visage frown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bared his broad bosom, rough with many a wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beaks and claws, disclosing to their sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious meed of high heroic might:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with insatiate vengeance, he pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never-ending hate, the feathery brood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy they, confiding in the length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horny beak, or talon's crooked strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who durst abide his rage; the blade descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the panting trunk the pinion rends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid low in dust the pinion waves no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trunk disfigur'd stiffens in its gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hosts of heroes fell beneath his force!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heaps of chicken carnage mark'd his course!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft, O Strymon, thy lone banks along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did wailing Echo waft the funeral song!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now from far the mingling clamours rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud and more loud rebounding through the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From skirt to skirt of heaven, with stormy sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud rolls on, and darkens all the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near and more near descends the dreadful shade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now in battalions array display'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sounding wings, and screaming in their ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cranes rush onward, and the fight require.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pigmy warriors eye with fearless glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host thick swarming o'er the burden'd air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick swarming now, but to their native land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doom'd to return a scanty straggling band&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sudden, darting down the depth of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce on th' expecting foe the cranes are driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kindling frenzy every bosom warms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The region echoes to the crash of arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose feathers from th' encountering armies fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in careering whirlwinds mount the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe from toil upsprings the panting crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with fresh vigour downward darts again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success in equal balance hovering hangs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, on the sharp spear, mad with mortal pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird transfix'd in bloody vortex whirls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fierce in death the threatening talon curls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, while the life-blood bubbles from his wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little feet the pigmy beats the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep from his breast the short, short sob he draws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dying curses the keen pointed claws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembles the thundering field, thick cover'd o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With falchions, mangled wings, and streaming gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pigmy arms, and beaks of ample size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here a claw, and there a finger lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Encompass'd round with heaps of slaughter'd foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All grim in blood the pigmy champion glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on th' assailing host impetuous springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of nibbling bills, and flapping wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And midst the tumult, wheresoe'er he turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle with redoubled fury burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side th' avenging cranes amain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throng, to o'erwhelm this terror of the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly (for such the will of Jove)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fowl enormous, sousing from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gallant chieftain clutch'd, and, soaring high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Sad chance of battle!) bore him up the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cranes pursue, and clustering in a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chatter triumphant round the captive king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! what pangs each pigmy bosom wrung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, now to cranes a prey, on talons hung,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the clouds they saw their helpless lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wriggling form still lessening as he soar'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lo! yet again, with unabated rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mortal strife the mingling hosts engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crane with darted bill assaults the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering; then wheels aloft to scape the blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dwarf in anguish aims the vengeful wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whirls in empty air the falchion round.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such was the scene, when midst the loud alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime th' eternal Thunderer rose in arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Briareus, by mad ambition driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heav'd Pelion huge, and hurl'd it high at heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove roll'd redoubling thunders from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains and bolts encounter'd in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one stupendous ruin whelm'd the crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vast limbs weltering wide in brimstone blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But now at length the pigmy legions yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wing'd with terror fly the fatal field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raise a weak and melancholy wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in distraction scattering o'er the vale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone on their routed rear the cranes descend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bills bite furious, and their talons rend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unrelenting ire they urge the chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sworn to exterminate the hated race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas thus the pigmy name, once great in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spoils of conquer'd cranes renown'd afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perish'd. For, by the dread decree of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short is the date to earthly grandeur given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vain are all attempts to roam beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fate has fix'd the everlasting bound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall'n are the trophies of Assyrian power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Persia's proud dominion is no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though to both superior far in fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine empire, Latium, is an empty name.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now with lofty chiefs of ancient time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pigmy heroes roam'd th' Elysian clime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if belief to matron-tales be due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oft, in the belated shepherd's view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their frisking forms, in gentle green array'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gambol secure amid the moonlight glade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure, for no alarming cranes molest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their woes in long oblivion rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the deep dale, and narrow winding way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They foot it featly, ranged in ringlets gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis joy and frolic all, where'er they rove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fairy-people is the name they love.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Attend to Famine's feeble moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or view the couch where Sickness lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark his pale cheek, and languid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His frame by strong convulsion torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His struggling sighs, and looks forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or see, transfix'd with keener pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where o'er his hoard the miser hangs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whistles the wind; he starts, he stares,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The jolly hunting band convene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beagle's breast with ardour burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounding steed the champaign spurns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fancy oft the game descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the hound's nose, and huntsman's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Just then, a council of the hares<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The chiefs were set; while o'er their head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The furze its frizzled covering spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long lists of grievances were heard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The youth, his parent's sole delight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose pulse in every vein beats strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose limbs leap light the vales along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May yet ere noontide meet his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lie dismember'd on the heath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For youth, alas, nor cautious age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor strength, nor speed, eludes their rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every field we meet the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each gale comes fraught with sounds of woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning but awakes our fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening sees us bath'd in tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But must we ever idly grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor strive our fortunes to relieve?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small is each individual's force:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stratagem be our recourse;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The murderer to his cost may find<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whom Concord leads, and Hatred warms.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fire of vengeance seem'd to stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his swoln eyeball's yellow gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now the tumults of the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling confusedly from afar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swell in the wind. Now louder cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinct of hounds and men arise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the brake, with beating heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' assembled hares tumultuous start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, every straining nerve on wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away precipitately spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hunting band, a signal given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick thundering o'er the plain are driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er cliff abrupt, and shrubby mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And river broad, impetuous bound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now plunge amid the forest shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glance through the openings of the glades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now o'er the level valley sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with short steps strain up the steep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While backward from the hunter's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landscape like a torrent flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last an ancient wood they gain'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By pruner's axe yet unprofan'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the rest, by Nature rear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oak's majestic boughs appear'd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath, a copse of various hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In barbarous luxuriance grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No knife had curb'd the rambling sprays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hand had wove th' implicit maze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowering thorn, self-taught to wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hazel's stubborn stem entwin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bramble twigs were wreath'd around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough furze crept along the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here sheltering, from the sons of murther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hares drag their tir'd limbs no further.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">But lo, the western wind ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was loud, and roar'd the woods among;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rustling leaves, and crashing boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of woe and war arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hares distracted scour the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As terror and amazement drove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But danger, wheresoe'er they fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still seem'd impending o'er their head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now crowded in a grotto's gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hope extinct, they wait their doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire was the silence, till, at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from despair deriving strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody eye and furious look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A daring youth arose and spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"O wretched race, the scorn of Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom ills of every sort await!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, curs'd with keenest sense to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sharpest sting of every ill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say ye, who, fraught with mighty scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of liberty and vengeance dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What now remains? To what recess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we our weary steps address,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Fate is evermore pursuing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All ways and means to work our ruin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are we alone, of all beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condemn'd to misery worse than death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must we, with fruitless labour, strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In misery worse than death to live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No. Be the smaller ill our choice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dictates Nature's powerful voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death's pang will in a moment cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, All hail, eternal peace!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while he spoke, his words impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dire resolve to every heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A distant lake in prospect lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, glittering in the solar ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleam'd through the dusky trees, and shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trembling light along the grot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither with one consent they bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sorrows with their lives to end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While each, in thought, already hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water hissing in his ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast by the margin of the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceal'd within a thorny brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A linnet sate, whose careless lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amus'd the solitary day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless he sung, for on his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow no lasting trace impress'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly he heard a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of swift feet traversing the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick to the neighbouring tree he flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence trembling casts around his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No foe appear'd, his fears were vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleas'd he renews the sprightly strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hares, whose noise had caus'd his fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw with surprise the linnet's flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is there on Earth a wretch," they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whom our approach can strike with dread?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An instantaneous change of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tumult every bosom wrought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares the system-building sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, plodding on from youth to age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last on some foundation-dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has rear'd aloft his goodly scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prov'd his predecessors fools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bound all nature by his rules;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares he in that dreadful hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When injur'd Truth exerts her power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some new phenomenon to raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, bursting on his frighted gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its proud summit to the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proves the whole edifice unsound.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Children," thus spoke a hare sedate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who oft had known th' extremes of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In slight events the docile mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May hints of good instruction find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That our condition is the worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we with such misfortunes curst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all comparison defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was late the universal cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, an accident so slight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As yonder little linnet's flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made your stubborn heart confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(So your amazement bids me guess)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all our load of woes and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but a part of what he bears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where can he rest secure from harms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom even a helpless hare alarms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he repines not at his lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When past, the danger is forgot:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On yonder bough he trims his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with unusual rapture sings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we, less wretched, sink beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lighter ills, and rush to death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more of this unmeaning rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hear, my friends, the words of age.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"When by the winds of autumn driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scatter'd clouds fly cross the heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft have we, from some mountain's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld th' alternate light and shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep the long vale. Here, hovering, lowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy cloud; there downward pours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streaming direct, a flood of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from the view flies swift away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flies, while other shades advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other streaks of sunshine glance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus chequer'd is the life below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gleams of joy and clouds of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hope not, while we journey on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still to be basking in the sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear, though now in shades ye mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sunshine will no more return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, by your terrors overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye fly before th' approaching gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapid clouds your flight pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkness still o'ercasts your view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who longs to reach the radiant plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must onward urge his course amain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For doubly swift the shadow flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When 'gainst the gale the pilgrim plies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least be firm, and undismay'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maintain your ground; the fleeting shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long spontaneous glides away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives you back th' enlivening ray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, while I speak, our danger past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the shrill horn's angry blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howls in our ear; the savage roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of war and murder is no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then snatch the moment fate allows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor think of past or future woes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke; and hope revives; the lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant one and all forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet amusement to employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present sprightly hour of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now from the western mountain's brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compass'd with clouds of various glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun a broader orb displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shoots aslope his ruddy rays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawn assumes a fresher green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dewdrops spangle all the scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The balmy zephyr breathes along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd sings his tender song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all their lays the groves resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falling waters murmur round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discord and care were put to flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was peace, and calm delight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our author mentions not the period,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Allow'd the beasts sometimes to teach us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now we all are prattlers grown,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas early on a Summer morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Wolf forsook the mountain-den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And issued hungry on the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a stream and lawn he pass'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reach'd a winding vale at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where from a hollow rock he spy'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds drest in flowery pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Garlands were strow'd, and all was gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To celebrate an holiday.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merry tabor's gamesome sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provok'd the sprightly dance around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard by a rural board was rear'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which in fair array appear'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peach, the apple, and the raisin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the fruitage of the season.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, more distinguish'd than the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen a wether ready drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That smoking, recent from the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffus'd a stomach-rousing steam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our wolf could not endure the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outrageous grew his appetite:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His entrails groan'd with tenfold pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lick'd his lips, and lick'd again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, with lightning in his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bounces forth, and fiercely cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shepherds, I am not given to scolding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now my spleen I cannot hold in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Jove, such scandalous oppression<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would put an elephant in passion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, who your flocks (as you pretend)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wholesome laws from harm defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which make it death for any beast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For sheep have right to life and health;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can you commit, uncheck'd by shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What in a beast so much you blame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is a law, if those who make it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Become the forwardest to break it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The case is plain: you would reserve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All to yourselves, while others starve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such laws from base self-interest spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not from the reason of the thing&mdash;"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He was proceeding, when a swain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst out&mdash;"And dares a wolf arraign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His betters, and condemn their measures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And contradict their wills and pleasures?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have establish'd laws, 'tis true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But laws are made for such as you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, sirrah, in its very nature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A law can't reach the legislature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For laws, without a sanction join'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all men know, can never bind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sanctions reach not us the makers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who dares punish us though breakers?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis therefore plain, beyond denial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That laws were ne'er design'd to tie all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those, whom sanctions reach alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stand accountable to none.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, 'tis evident, that, seeing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laws from the great derive their being,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They as in duty bound should love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great, in whom they live and move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbly yield to their desires:<br /></span>

<p class="center">[Part of a letter to a person of quality.</p>


<p>* * * * * * * Lest your Lordship, who are so well
acquainted with every thing that relates to true
honour, should think hardly of me for attacking
the memory of the dead, I beg leave to offer a
few words in my own vindication.</p>

<p>If I had composed the following verses, with a
view to gratify private resentment, to promote the
interest of any faction, or to recommend myself to
the patronage of any person whatsoever, I should
have been altogether inexcusable. To attack the
memory of the dead from selfish considerations,
or from mere wantonness of malice, is an enormity
which none can hold in greater detestation than I.
But I composed them from very different motives;
as every intelligent reader, who peruses them with
attention, and who is willing to believe me upon
my own testimony, will undoubtedly perceive.
My motives proceeded from a sincere desire to
do some small service to my country, and to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
cause of truth and virtue. The promoters of faction
I ever did, and ever will consider as the
enemies of mankind; to the memory of such I
owe no veneration; to the writings of such I owe
no indulgence.</p>

<p>Your Lordship knows that * * * * * owed the
greatest share of his renown to the most incompetent
of all judges, the mob; actuated by the
most unworthy of all principles, a spirit of insolence;
and inflamed by the vilest of all human
passions, hatred to their fellow-citizens. Those
who joined the cry in his favour seemed to me to
be swayed rather by fashion than by real sentiment.
He therefore might have lived and died
unmolested by me; confident as I am, that posterity,
when the present unhappy dissensions are
forgotten, will do ample justice to his real character.
But when I saw the extravagant honours
that were paid to his memory, and heard that a
monument in Westminster Abbey was intended
for one, whom even his admirers acknowledge to
have been an incendiary and a debauchee, I could
not help wishing that my countrymen would reflect
a little on what they were doing, before they
consecrated, by what posterity would think the
public voice, a character which no friend to <i>virtue</i>
or to <i>true taste</i> can approve. It was this sentiment,
enforced by the earnest request of a friend,
which produced the following little poem; in
which I have said nothing of * * * * *'s manners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
that is not warranted by the best authority; nor
of his writings, that is not perfectly agreeable to
the opinion of many of the most competent judges
in Britain. * * * * * * * *, January 1765.]</p>

<span class="i0">To roam with toil, in restless uproar hurl'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One little corner of a little world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can this enlarge or dignify the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wing unwearied darts from pole to pole?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can glowworms glitter on the car of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or gold the progeny of heaven adorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How long, enamour'd of fictitious joy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Meanwhile behind, with renovated force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care and disgust pursue our slackening course,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And long ere Death, sole friend of the distrest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus, wayward hope still wandering from within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lur'd by the phantoms of th' external scene;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Can man be happy in his Maker's spite?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain thankless man, averse to Nature's sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feels every moment that he must obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close and more closely clasp the stubborn chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each new struggle rouses keener pains.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till each fantastic hope expire in woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold cheerless heart forget to glow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Joy was not made for man, and life is vain."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sweet peace of heart, from false desire refin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pour'st elysian sunshine on the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O come, bid each tumultuous wish be still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend to nature's law each froward will.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Hope's wild wing ne'er stoop to Fortune's sphere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For terror, anguish, discontent are there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soar with strong and steady flight sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where disappointment never dar'd to climb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O come, serenely gay, and with thee bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vital breath of heaven's eternal spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' amusive dream of blameless fancy born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The calm oblivious night, and sprightly morn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring Resignation, undebas'd with fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Melancholy, serious, not severe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fortitude, by chance nor time controll'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meek with the gentle, with the haughty bold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devotion deck'd in smiles of filial love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thought, conversing with the worlds above.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So shall my days nor vain nor joyless roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with regret survey th' approaching goal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too happy, if I gain that noblest prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The well-earn'd favour of the Good and Wise.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_59" id="Footnote_1_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_59"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It has been observed by some critics, who have treated of
pastoral poetry, that, in every poem of this kind, it is proper,
that the scene or landscape, connected with the little plot or
fable on which the poem is founded, be delineated with at least
as much accuracy, as is sufficient to render the description particular
and picturesque. How far Virgil has thought fit to
attend to such a rule may appear from the remarks which the
translator has subjoined to every Pastoral.
</p><p>
The scene of the first pastoral is pictured out with great
accuracy. The shepherds Melib&#339;us and Tityrus are represented
as conversing together beneath a spreading beech tree.
Flocks and herds are feeding hard by. At a little distance
we behold, on the one hand a great rock, and on the other a
fence of flowering willows. The prospect as it widens is
diversified with groves, and streams, and some tall trees,
particularly elms. Beyond all these appear marshy grounds,
and rocky hills. The ragged and drooping flock of the unfortunate
shepherd, particularly the she goat which he leads
along, are no inconsiderable figures in this picture.&mdash;The
time is the evening of a summer day, a little before sunset.
See the Original, v. 1, 5, 9, 52, 54, 67, 69, 81, &amp;c.
</p><p>
This Pastoral is said to have been written on the following
occasion. Augustus, in order to reward the services of his
veterans, by means of whom he had established himself in the
Roman empire, distributed among them the lands that lay
contiguous to Mantua and Cremona. To make way for these
intruders, the rightful owners, of whom Virgil was one, were
turned out. But our poet, by the intercession of Mec&aelig;nas,
was reinstated in his possessions. Melib&#339;us here personates
one of the unhappy exiles, and Virgil is represented under
the character of Tityrus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_60" id="Footnote_2_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_60"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The refinements of Taubmannus, De La Cerda, and
others, who will have Amaryllis to signify Rome, and Galatea
to signify Mantua, have perplexed this passage not a little:
if the literal meaning be admitted, the whole becomes obvious
and natural.</p></div>

<span class="i0">The lowly woods, and rural life be mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lioness all dreadful in her course<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flies at the wanton goat, that loves to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cliff's steep side, and crop the flowering thyme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee Corydon pursues, O beauteous boy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus each is drawn along by some peculiar joy.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Now evening soft comes on; and homeward now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From field the weary oxen bear the plough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The setting Sun now beams more mildly bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadows lengthening with the level light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with love's flame my restless bosom glows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love no interval of ease allows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah Corydon! to weak complaints a prey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What madness thus to waste the fleeting day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be rous'd at length; thy half-prun'd vines demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The needful culture of thy curbing hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, lingering swain, the flexile willows weave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with thy wonted care thy wants relieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget Alexis' unrelenting scorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another love thy passion will return.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_62" id="Footnote_1_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_62"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The chief excellency of this poem consists in its delicacy
and simplicity. Corydon addresses his favourite in such a
purity of sentiment as one would think might effectually discountenance
the prepossessions which generally prevail against
the subject of this eclogue. The nature of his affection may
easily be ascertained from his ideas of the happiness which
he hopes to enjoy in the company of his beloved Alexis.

<p class="noidt">It appears to have been no other than that friendship, which
was encouraged by the wisest legislators of ancient Greece, as
a noble incentive to virtue, and recommended by the example
even of Agesilaus, Pericles, and Socrates: an affection wholly
distinct from the infamous attachments that prevailed among
the licentious. The reader will find a full and satisfying account
of this generous passion in Dr. Potter's Antiquities of
Greece, B. iv. chap. 9. Mons. Bayle, in his Dictionary at
the article Virgile, has at great length vindicated our poet
from the charge of immorality which the critics have grounded
upon this pastoral.

The scene of this pastoral is a grove interspersed with
beech-trees; the season, harvest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_67" id="Footnote_1_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_67"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In this fourth pastoral, no particular landscape is delineated.
The whole is a prophetic song of triumph. But as
almost all the images and allusions are of the rural kind, it is
no less a true bucolic than the others; if we admit the definition
of a pastoral, given us by an author of the first rank,<a name="FNanchor_A_68" id="FNanchor_A_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_68" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
who calls it "A poem in which any action or passion is represented
by its effects upon country life."
</p><p>
It is of little importance to inquire on what occasion this
poem was written. The spirit of prophetic enthusiasm that
breathes through it, and the resemblance it bears in many
places to the Oriental manner, make it not improbable, that
our poet composed it partly from some pieces of ancient prophecy
that might have fallen into his hands, and that he
afterwards inscribed it to his friend and patron Pollio, on occasion
of the birth of his son Salonius.</p></div>

number of significations that have been offered, the translator
has pitched upon one, which he thinks the most agreeable to
the scope of the poem and most consistent with the language

this head, may consult Servius, De La Cerda, or Ru&aelig;us.</p></div>

Daphnis in the most distinguished place, Corydon, Thyrsis,
and Melib&#339;us, are seen reclining beneath an holm. Sheep
and goats intermixed are feeding hard by. At a little distance
Mincius, fringed with reeds, appears winding along.
Fields and trees compose the surrounding scene. A venerable
oak, with bees swarming around it, is particularly distinguished.
The time seems to be the forenoon of a summerday.</p></div>

The poet rehearses the songs of two contending swains, Damon

a despairing lover: the latter chooses for his subject the magic
rites of an enchantress forsaken by her lover, and recalling
him by the power of her spells.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_98" id="Footnote_1_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_98"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This and the first eclogue seem to have been written on
the same occasion. The time is a still evening. The landscape
is described at the 97th line of this translation. On
one side of the highway is an artificial arbour, where Lycidas
invites M&#339;ris to rest a little from the fatigue of his journey:
and at a considerable distance appears a sepulchre by the
way-side, where the ancient sepulchres were commonly
erected.
</p><p>
The critics with one voice seem to condemn this eclogue as
unworthy of its author; I know not for what good reason.
The many beautiful lines scattered through it would, one
might think, be no weak recommendation. But it is by no
means to be reckoned a loose collection of incoherent fragments;
its principal parts are all strictly connected, and refer
to a certain end, and its allusions and images are wholly
suited to pastoral life. Its subject, though uncommon, is not
improper; for what is more natural, than that two shepherds,
when occasionally mentioning the good qualities of their absent
friend, particularly his poetical talents, should repeat
such fragments of his songs as they recollected?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_99" id="Footnote_2_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_99"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> These lines, which Virgil has translated literally from
Theocritus, may be supposed to be a fragment of a poem
mentioned in the preceding verses; or, what is more likely,
to be spoken by Lycidas to his servant; something similar to
which may be seen Past. 5. v. 20. of this translation.&mdash;The
original is here remarkably explicit, even to a degree of affectation.
This the translator has endeavoured to imitate.</p></div>

<span class="i0">So may thy waters pure of briny stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traverse the waves of the Sicilian main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing, mournful Muse, of Gallus' luckless love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To what lone woodland, or what devious lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Gallus' bosom languish'd with the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hopeless love, and unallay'd desire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For neither by th' Aonian spring you stray'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor roam'd Parnassus' heights, nor Pindus' hallow'd shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pines of M&aelig;nalus were heard to mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounds of woe along the groves were borne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sympathetic tears the laurel shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbler shrubs declin'd their drooping head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wept his fate, when to despair resign'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a desert-cliff he lay reclin'd.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Renown'd Adonis by the lonely stream<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The god of verse vouchsafed to join the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "What phrensy thus torments thy breast?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"For ever wilt thou heave the bursting sigh?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whilst thou, relentless to my constant flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ah could I disbelieve the voice of fame!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from thy home, unaided and forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from thy love, thy faithful love, art borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bleak Alps with chilling blast to pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wander waste along the frozen Rhine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye icy paths, O spare her tender form!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O spare those heavenly charms, thou wintry storm!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Hence let me hasten to some desert-grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soothe with songs my long unanswer'd love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I go, in some lone wilderness to suit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eub&#339;an lays to my Sicilian flute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better with beasts of prey to make abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the deep cavern, or the darksome wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carve on trees the story of my woe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O'er rocks and cliffs, and hear the woods resound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now with beating heart I seem to wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cretan arrow from the Parthian string&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Were all in vain. Love's unresisted sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extends to all, and we must love obey."<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis done: ye Nine, here ends your poet's strain<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Let us begone: at eve, the shade annoys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With noxious damps, and hurts the singer's voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The juniper breathes bitter vapours round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kill the springing corn, and blast the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homeward, my sated goats, now let us hie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo beamy Hesper gilds the western sky.<br /></span>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_102" id="Footnote_1_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_102"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The scene of this pastoral is very accurately delineated.
We behold the forlorn Gallus stretched along beneath a solitary
cliff, his flocks standing round him at some distance. A
group of deities and swains encircle him, each of whom is
particularly described. On one side we see the shepherds
with their crooks; next to them the neatherds, known by the
clumsiness of their appearance; and next to these Menalcas
with his clothes wet, as just come from beating or gathering
winter-mast. On the other side we observe Apollo with his
usual insignia; Sylvanus crowned with flowers, and brandishing
in his hand the long lilies and flowering fennel; and
last of all, Pan, the god of shepherds, known by his ruddy
smiling countenance, and the other peculiarities of his form.
</p><p>
Gallus was a Roman of very considerable rank, a poet of
no small estimation, and an intimate friend of Virgil. He
loved to distraction one Cytheris (here called Lycoris) who
slighted him, and followed Antony into Gaul.</p></div>
